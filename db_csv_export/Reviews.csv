4,9,Overlooked among Romero's filmography.,"While this will likely never be considered one of filmmaker George Romero's best, it still represents a commendable effort in one of his rare forays into studio productions (in this case Orion). Scripted by Romero based on a novel by Michael Stewart, it tells the story of Allan Mann (handsome Jason Beghe), a law student who gets into a horrible accident that renders him a quadriplegic. He soon becomes despondent enough to attempt suicide, but soon he receives some temporary salvation in the form of Ella (Boo), a capuchin monkey who is trained to see to his needs. What he doesn't know is that his friend Geoffrey (John Pankow) has been playing mad scientist and injecting the cute lil' thing with human brain cells. Soon the bond between patient and helper becomes so strong that a mental connection is made, and Ella is physically acting out Allan's worst impulses. So what is he going to do about this little homicidal primate? Romero does a good job here at telling a fairly interesting story, although some viewers might be turned off at the lack of sympathetic characters. Most of them are flawed to some degree or another - creepy dean Burbage (Stephen Root), smarmy, incompetent doctor Wiseman (Stanley Tucci), fair-weather girlfriend Linda (Janine Turner), bitchy nurse Maryanne (Christine Forrest, a.k.a. Mrs. Romero) - and even a guy like Geoffrey, who initially just wants to help, has his problems as he's obsessed with his work. At least Allan has an appealing love interest played by Kate McNeil, whom horror fans will recognize as the lead in the slasher ""The House on Sorority Row"". The cast is pretty good overall; Joyce Van Patten plays the stereotypically smothering mother to good effect, and it's a treat to see character actors Root and Tucci near the beginnings of their careers, but the one performer the audience is likely to remember is Boo, who's adorable and very well trained; the animal action is first rate throughout (there's also a rather annoying bird on hand). The evolving relationship between Allan and Ella makes for a compelling hook, and it makes one appreciate the real-life efforts that people put into training service animals, and the animals themselves. The film is light on horror - most of the violence is implied - as Romero tends to go for a more psychological approach, and refrains from going for the gore. Overall, this is a decent flick, worth a look for genre fans who are interested in checking out Romero's non-zombie films. Seven out of 10.",6
4,3,Not your run of the mill horror,"Unexpectedly intense classic, a unique abnormal experience! It's about a man who gets in a severe injury and makes friends with a monkey that even helps him until the monkey gets super vicious/evil. Unlike most George A. Romero films, very refreshing and enjoyable to see how things play out.",7
4,7,Monkey Shines (1988),"George Romero does an excellent job of swapping Zombies for Monkeys. This film may sound ridiculous in the most preposterous way. But then again, we now live in a world of Snakes on a Plane and Burning Bright, so this is a little easier to swallow. In its genre, it is one of the best examples, and I'm not just talking about killer animals. I'm also referring to the stalker/obsessive partner/friend genre. What Romero does brilliantly, is to take a number of characters and the audience on a journey of emotions and self discovery. For example, I started off wanting one of these monkeys. The relationship built up is a genuinely loving one. It's really cute, and this could easily be one of those lifetime inspirational movies. If the monkey wasn't a genetically modified, telepathic, homicidal, psycho monkey. The well trained monkey takes us from tragic victim of experiments, to a loving carer. We get a wonderful cleaning montage, as the monkey helps the friendship expands. The monkey's obsession grows steadily. It starts off with a few temper tantrums and escalates into bananas in the slippers. Soon bananas turn to murder. It's the evolution of all species.None of this would work if it wasn't for a dramatic human connection. Beghe is a law student/athlete that is paralysed. He goes through acceptance, denial, frustration, which is understandable as his girlfriend leaves him for his doctor (a sleazy Tucci), he gets a patronizing nurse, and then his overbearing mother. It's great to see how the characters react to Beghe's quadriplegia, as it enforces Beghe's later anger. Beghe also does a terrific job of facial acting, which is most important as he can't use his body. In a single look he can convey the embarrassment of his mother having to wash him. On the surface, this is a story of a monkey being a bitch to a cripple. But look deep down, REAAAAAAALLY deep, and you'll see a social commentary. For a long time, the monkey is the only one that treats Beghe as an equal. It doesn't throw money at his problem, try and cheer him up, nor can the monkey do everything for him. Romero fills the film with dread, absurdity, and most of all a serious edge that clearly does the film justice. It's easy to mock this film. But the truth is, this could actually happen. Monkeys are creepy and untrustworthy.",9
4,4,Underrated Romero film,"This film has been described as a ""horror film for people who don't like horror films.""  That's an apt description for this underrated psychological/supernatural thriller from Pittsburgh's master horror director, George A. Romero.  To date, this is Romero's only studio film, and he had to make numerous compromises to the finished product.  (The originally intended ending would have been a killer.)  That said, the film still comes off as smart and sharp, with some very good casting. (John Pankow, recognizable from ""Mad About You,"" is really excellent here, and there are nice early performances from Stephen Root, Stanley Tucci, and Janine Turner.)  And check out the amazingly good editing in the last 10 minutes.  Overall, while this is not first-tier Romero, it's a terrific little horror film.",9
11,3,Innovated Hong Kong Action-Comedy!,"I thought that was excellent for the Shaw films I have seen so far.This film is excellent because it looks great. The cinematography was really nice for one of these films, framed with thought. The zooming in this film was not bad and there weren't any reaction capturing close up zooms that these films are littered with.One specific moment that I found questionable was using light for a useless little scare on the audience. Making a character lit bright green. It worked in that characters opening shot, but some later shots specifically looked not real and extra light hit the clothing they were wearing rather than just the face, which works something special.There was a nice story here. A conman's travels and eventual settling in a certain village he has fooled for a long time. He was a good hearted defend the poor and treat the bourgeoisie like arse, but he puts his own self before the poor.The main actor Yue Wong is great. A real special character and performance. His kung fu was excellent, I love that animal style stuff specifically when Jackie Chan in 'Around the World in 80 Days,' one of my childhood films, does the demonstration of the different styles, so I was very impressed and surprised when this was a part of the plot. The kung fu all round, in fact, is incredible, it was probably the better of the chopsocky Shaw films I have seen so far. 'The Brave Archer' had some excellent kung fu but it was not raw, it was supernatural stuff which has a different spellbounding affect on the audience.The action comedy preceding 'Drunken Master' demonstrates action scenes with comedic moments and then brutality which is exactly what Jackie Chan did with his movies, and it is done competitively so here.The opening scene has the opening titles freeze framing a demonstration to the audience of some true spiritual boxing which is just so magnificent. It sets a wonderful scene for a great kung fu movie and a well done story, foreshadowing and pay off. Well done.",9
11,4,A knave come good,"Brian Camp, as usual, reviews this film very well but it is more fun than he makes it sound. Wang (Wong) Yu is very likable and the storyline is strong and interesting. I found the final fight against the robbers more convincing than he did, with Wang's original master urging him on to use the correct counter style from the side lines. He is actually saved in the end by the police and unusually he doesn't fight the main villains including the versatile Fung Hak On (who doesn't really get to show his fighting skills). I also want to mention the humour which apart from the usual unbelievable not recognising the beautiful girl as man joke, is quite good and well handled - particularly in the funny exorcism scene. I really enjoyed this film and though it's not a classic, as Lau Kar Leung's directorial debut it showed real promise.",5
11,7,"THE SPIRITUAL BOXER Â– the kung fu of the ""gods""","THE SPIRITUAL BOXER (1975) marks the film directing debut of Lau Kar Leung who had directed action scenes for most of Chang Cheh's martial arts epics up to that point. Fans should not expect from this film a kung fu extravaganza along the lines of Lau's later films, CHALLENGE OF THE MASTERS, EXECUTIONERS FROM SHAOLIN, THE 36TH CHAMBER OF SHAOLIN, DIRTY HO, LEGENDARY WEAPONS OF KUNG FU and 8-DIAGRAM POLE FIGHTER. This one differs not only from Lau's other films but from the standard Shaw Bros. martial arts adventure in general. I would almost hesitate to even call it a kung fu film since it is less about martial arts and more about the kind of Chinese folk superstitions that enabled the ill-fated Boxer Rebellion to gain so many followers at the turn of the last century. It's all about a con artist, Siu Chien (Wang Yu) who pretends to be a master of ""spiritual boxing"" and invoke gods in elaborate performance routines that fool townspeople in his travels to shower him with gifts, free food and money. When real martial artists see through his tricks, he is generally forced to flee.The film opens with an elaborate prologue showing off the original Boxers as they demonstrate their powers to the Empress Dowager. Shaw Bros. kung fu stars Chen Kuan Tai and Ti Lung appear in cameos as the Boxers here. The action then shifts to a series of vignettes showing ""Master Siu"" and his varied encounters with merchants, police, wealthy nobles and assorted villagers before he settles in a town suffering from the harsh rule of a local crime boss whose loansharking activities have put a lot of farmers in his debt. Along the way, Siu has picked up a female sidekick, Jin Lian, who dresses as a man and helps him out with his tricks. Eventually, Master Siu becomes so confident of his own powers that he stands up to the loanshark and his gang and teaches the people kung fu to defend themselves. When a pair of wanted outlaws, both kung fu experts in their own right, come to town to help the crime boss, they expose Siu's trickery and put him in a real bind.There are few genuine martial arts thrills in the film. Instead, the fun is in watching Siu interact with ordinary villagers, particularly children and the various farmers and merchants he helps. The film captures numerous details of everyday life in small-town China 100 years ago and appears to have been shot in Taiwan, far from the familiar backlot of the Shaw Bros. Hong Kong studio where Lau shot most of his films. If anything, the elaborate kung fu finale makes for a curiously unsatisfying ending, partly because it is somewhat unconvincing given everything that's come before it.The lead actor is Wang Yu (aka Wong Yu, star of DIRTY HO, YOUNG AVENGER, HE HAS NOTHING BUT KUNG FU and many others and not to be confused with Jimmy Wang Yu, star of ONE-ARMED SWORDSMAN, Chinese BOXER, et al). There are a few familiar Shaw Bros. regulars, but not as many as normal for a high-profile Shaw film. The lead actress, Lin Chen Chi, is spunky, funny and quite beautiful, even when dressed as a man, but she's someone I've never seen before and apparently left the film business after a handful of films. Perennial kung fu villains Fung Hak On and Lee Hoi San, more familiar to viewers of Sammo Hung's films, are on hand to provide formidable opposition to the hero.Lau Kar Leung's later films would focus more on genuine martial arts styles and skills and elaborate training scenes. This one is simply a treatise on how a skilled and clever trickster could exploit villagers' superstitions and profit from it but, in a strategy common even in Hollywood, eventually turn his con artist skills to the public good. A follow-up film by Lau, THE SHADOW BOXING (aka SPIRITUAL BOXER 2, 1979, also reviewed on this site), is not a sequel but deals with a similar theme, although much less effectively.",7
11,9,"Okay, but lacks a certain something","THE SPIRITUAL BOXER is as handsomely mounted as many a Shaw Brothers production, but the plot lacks a certain something. The hero of the piece is Wong Yue, playing a confidence trickster who employs various methods to convince audiences that he's possessed by the spirits of various gods, thus making a living from people's gullibility. After a while, he makes enemies of a gang of thugs while at the same time being asked to investigate a haunted temple.The film is notable for being one of the first examples of the knockabout comedy genre later popularised by Jackie Chan. Wong Yue gets up to all manner of mischief with his tricks, but he lacks the genuine charisma of many of his peers. Still, there's much fun to be had with burning coals, red hot pokers and the like, although my favourite segment is the pure horror scene in a haunted building which is up there with the best of Hong Kong's black magic movies.THE SPIRITUAL BOXER lacks the kind of well-choreographed action that we know so well from the studio's classics, but that's not to say that it's without incident. Scenes of Wong Yue getting possessed by the monkey god and the like are a lot of fun and neatly prefigure later movies like KNOCKABOUT or ENCOUNTERS OF THE SPOOKY KIND. Fung Hark-On has a meaty role as an antagonist and there's an odd opening sequence featuring Ti Lung and Chen Kuan Tai which has nothing to do with the rest of the movie. In the end, this is a watchable movie but it's not as funny as others and doesn't have the great action of others, so it's rather an odd, middling combo.",8
12,5,Who's Really in Control?,"*Please note: This review discusses many key events of the film, including the end.  Do not read if you have not seen the movie!!!Taxi Blues is a film about control.  It isn't, however, as simple as it initially seems.  At the film's conclusion, the audience is left to ask, ""Who's really controlling whom?""At the beginning of this film, Chlykov has complete control of his life. He manages his cab, and his side job of selling alcohol, with an iron fist and the facial expression to match.  He is the master of his domain and no one in his or her right mind would dare to question his authority in any way.The problem is that Lyosha is not in his right mind.  His life is careening out of control and he has one priority.  Alcohol.  From the minute that he requests his first bottle from Chlykov, their lives become irrevocably entangled.  In the beginning, it is very clear where the power lies.  As the film continues, however, it becomes harder and harder to tell who is controlling whom.  Although he does not seem to realize it, Chlykov's life begins to revolve around the very man he seeks to reform.  As a result, aspects of his own life start to slip from his control.For example, when Lyosha begins to seduce his girlfriend, Chlykov, in a desperate attempt to prove his authority, smashes Lyosha's saxophone and then engages Christina in an aggressive sexual act against her will.  For those few minutes, Chlykov is free of his self-induced commitment to Lyosha. However, his freedom is short-lived.  A few minutes later the phone rings and he is soon back at the jail to meet Lyosha, once again putting his own life on hold.By the end of the film, the roles have reversed.  Lyosha gets his life together, at least temporarily, and is on top of the world as a beloved, world-renowned musician.  Chlykov's life, however, is reminiscent of Lyosha's at the beginning of the film.  He severs connections with his girlfriend, his friends and his once structured existence.  It is no coincidence that in the last scenes of the film, Chlykov is in a speeding car, spinning wildly out of control.",7
12,4,"The film about two men, about soviet union - they need energy, about new oxygen to survive...","This film is more deeper thats you can imagine. This film is about 2 Russian souls, two tragical souls in the 1980xx( at the end of soviet union). This men are the parallel to the soviet - both are tragical, needs new oxygen, new energy to survive! I think that only Russians can understand that cinema, its very hard to see this film, if you are not living in Russia. Unreal playing by actors, amazing Vladimir Cherkasin soundtracksIf you like this film, you can see all the films with Petr Mamonov or films by Pavel Lungin.I think that this film is more than 10/10",9
12,2,Excellently brooding and moody piece of work on Russia during the latter stages of Perestroika.,"Besides this, I have only seen one movie by Pavel Lungin, namely Luna-park, which also comes off highly recommended.  Taxi Blues is an excellent work all in itself.  Lungin very well transcends the chaotic atmosphere in Russia during the late Perestroika period, and prior to the break-up of the Soviet Union itself.  The tumultous relationship between two main characters represents bipolar parts of the Russian society, and shows degradation of the social fabric.  Piotr Mamonov (who is also the leader of the well-known Moscow rock-band Zvuki Moo) turns in an impressive performance as Lyosha - a westernized, alcoholic Jewish mucisian. The rest of the characters are equally picturesqe, be it the strong willed, conservative, nationalistic taxi driver, or his neighbor, an old man of the Stalinist generation. The film's unsettling pacing and incessant moodswings further contribute to the overall picture. An excellent film from one of Russia's leading directors.",10
12,6,A patriotic cabbie tries to change a lazy alcoholic Jew.,"This film shows the conflict and forming of a friendship between two opposites: Shlykov, the hard-working patriotic cab driver built like a tank, and Lyosha, the thin, panhandling urban Jew.A taxi driver in Moscow named Shlykov gets stiffed of his fare by the Jewish saxophone player named Lyosha who calls himself a genius who ""speaks to God"". Shlykov tracks down Lyosha and takes his saxophone and that is when the fun begins.Lyosha fails to make money fast enough to pay Shlykov back but Shlykov decides to give him back his saxophone anyways. Lyosha, sensing Shlykov's soft heart, tries to further take advantage of him by begging him for money. After Shlykov lets Lyosha in his apartment, and after Lyosha causes him great trouble costing him even more money, Shlykov takes Lyosha to jail.After a violent outburst by Shlykov he decides to go back to the police station to drop the charges against Lyosha. He has decided that sending Lyosha to jail would accomplish nothing. He wants to show Lyosha what life is like for honest hard-working people. Shlykov makes Lyosha come to work with him. The ""intellectual"" breaks down when forced to do what millions of other people in the country have to do everyday of their lives. Both characters show impulsive and unpredictable behaviour, but for different reason. Lyosha is simply a drunk. Shlykov is a patriotic ex-athlete full of proletariat angst and senses his nation is dying because of the ""rotten"" westernized hooligans he sees everywhere in the streets who lack any work ethic.I will not reveal the ending to you but I will tell you this story is not a fairy tale.I think this film goes much deeper than just showing what life was like in the USSR; the two characters can be found in almost every culture in the world today.Excellent performances by both Zajchenko and Mamonov.",9
13,1,Screwball at it's best,"Burns and Allen who usually were in support of other stars got to carry this one by themselves. It is a laugh riot from start to finish. Trying to keep his normal daughter, Betty Furness from marrying a gigolo, George Barbier turns over his fortune to his other dimwitted daughter, Gracie Allen. What follows is one madcap situation after another as Gracie turns their home into a hotel for unemployed actors and then decided to produce her own show.As good as Gracie is, mention must be made of George Barbier. A fine character actor who played fathers, his blustering reactions to Gracie's schemes are worth seeing the movie in and of themselves.",9
13,2,A Historical Treasure,"The plot is thin but the casting is stuffed with major faces from the heydey of Vaudeville.  For most of these performers, uncredited as they were, this is the only recording of parts of their act.  Enjoy the silliness and pretend you're at Minsky's.",10
13,8,a pleasant and occasionally very amusing Gracie Allen movie,"The plot is thin, the premise even thinner. However, Grace Allen is her usual ebullient self, somehow even in her ""dimwittedness"" suggesting that some shrewd insights lie beneath the surface, and that everyone else is only a fall guy. The scenes with father and sister are sometimes extremely amusing, but the primary distinctive feature of the film is that it gives the viewer the opportunity to see many of the old vaudeville acts in their pristine form, as Gracie the heiress opens her home to the out of work performers. Probably these were performers who appeared in vaudeville with Burns and Allen themselves.",7
13,5,It's actually a Barbier and Allen vehicle!,"Although billed as a Burns and Allen vehicle, it's actually George Barbier who has the main role and carries the weight of the comedy in this enjoyable, well-produced ""B"" movie. Not that I'm complaining. Barbier is not only more than equal to the task, he carries off more laughs than the dithery Miss AllenÂ—who is delightfully partnered here not only by Barbier but by Andrew Tombes who makes the most of one of his largest and most ingratiating roles ever. George Burns has only a small role and seems to have been included in the cast simply to serve as an occasional butt for why-don't-you-marry-Gracie jokes.Other players who register more strongly than Mr Burns include Betty Furness (as the daughter who comes to her senses), Rafael Storm (as the money hound), James Burke (as the fake swami), Syd Saylor (a credulous taxi-driver), and Harry Holman (a disillusioned crony).As for the twelve (count them) vaudeville headline acts announced in the credit titles, we see only two (three if you count the fact that drummer Jack Powell is handed two bites), although five or six others flit by in the background.",7
14,1,A wonderfully imaginative movie,"Ignore the negative rabble expressed above. Rent the movie, and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. ""Joe's Apartment"" has more creativity and originality in it than most of the films I've seen in 1999. Great concept, great animation/set designs, great fun.",10
14,3,Funny and well shot,"I was quite surprised when I saw the mark given by the IMDb users to this film. Indeed, even though it's not the best movie of the century, I found it quite entertaining and ""fresh"".I loved the way it is shot, there is a real work on the layouts that makes Joe's apartment look dirty and moving at the same time. Besides, the visual effects are well done for a film that dates back to 1996. They are not THAT impressive but they are very efficient to create the funny atmosphere. I could not describe the way I laughed rolling on the floor when I saw those roaches watching an ""insect porn movie"", it cracked me up.This movie is worth seeing for sure and does not deserve such a mark. Everyone who's curious should watch it to make his/her own opinion and should not pay attention to the five miserable stars given to the film.",8
14,4,Pretty original black humor comedy,"I've seen this many years ago when it just came out and now decided to watch it again. I remember it was pretty funny but then I was maybe 7 years old so now I was expecting this film to be stupid. I was surprised how clever this film was. The humor was sometimes stupid but in a good way. It also was kinda original humor sometimes. Jerry O'Connell played a naive new arrival to New York very well. It was so funny when I first saw his naive physiognomy just before he got robed. Jerry O'Connell is a really good comical actor. I also liked that Walter Sh!t character (played by Jim Turner), actually he was the reason why this comedy appeared original to me. It's also a half musical so there were few songs performed by Cockroaches, it was pretty clever made.",10
14,2,Totally off the wall creative genius,"I had never heard of this movie before my 16 year-old son rented the video. It is hilarious. Think of ""Babe"" as produced by the Marx Brothers, using singing cockroaches instead of mice . Evidently the critics didn't like it much, and I can see how they might not see it as high art, but as entertainment and an enjoyable time in fantasy land, it right up there with the best of them, in my opinion.",9
16,2,Only for Mischa Barton fans,"The talented and beautiful Mischa Barton is a good actress well above the usual CW standard. She deserves to make it big on the silver screen. However she seems to be doing a lot of bad b movies recently especially badly written horror movies. This movie was interminable, unpleasant, not very scary and overall a waste of time. Set in a gloomy building set for demolition, Mischa plays a demolition expert sent to assess the building and she encounters an even gloomier cast of characters there. The pace is glacial and the situations are just boring. Cameron Bright of the Twilight sequels isn't quite enough to carry the movie as supporting cast either.Unfortunately even as a fan of Mischa, it was a struggle to finish this boring dud.",2
16,1,Pa-the-tic,"PA-THE-TIC If you find boredom scary then 'Walled In' is truly terrifying.I'm not sure what the producers' plan was to take an incoherent story, really bad acting, really really bad production quality and mixing them together.The plot: A small town's (the typical horror movie small where cell phones and the internet don't work per horror movie criteria) factory and only source of employment closes down and leaves a 10 story apartment building standing in the middle of nowhere. A serial killer begins picking off the residents and entombing them into the building.15 or so years after the murders Sam Walczak (Get it!) your typical female, recent college grad, demolitions expert is sent to demolish the almost abandoned building.""Almost"" as there are still people living there. Sam even decides to stay in one of the apartments. Of course it is never explained why a 10 story rotting building with only a few squatters and set to be demolished still has working utilities.So what scary things happen to Sam? Nothing! And no the squatters don't turn out to be the ghosts of the victims. It's just plain boring.I cannot think of a single reason to see 'Walled In.'",1
16,9,"Yeah, I felt a little walled in myself","Walled In is the kind of horror film that sets itself up in a bizarre location and then explains all kinds of bizarre rules to make the scariness work. The movie opens with a series of headlines that explain the terrible discovery of 16 bodies cemented into the walls of a building, including that of the architect who designed it. We learn that the person who walled them in, Joseph Malestrazza, was never caught, and then we cut to 15 years later, when the building is planned to be demolished.Mischa Barton stars as Samantha, a young member of the demolition company family, perfectly named the Walczak's (the 'c' is silent). She recently graduated from engineering school and it becomes her first lone assignment to visit the building and supervise its demolition. It's a perfect set-up for a horror movie, I suppose, although as soon as we get to the building, the one where the 16 bodies were discovered, you remember, and learn that the wife and son of the murdered architect are still living there, the movie takes a pretty serious turn for the worse. I would think that if a man suffered the terrible fate of being murdered and cemented into the walls of a building, his wife would take it upon herself not to raise their son for his entire life in that building. But that's me.Upon her arrival we meet the woman living there and her creepy son, who explains things to Samantha that the lights go off every six minutes to conserve energy, she shouldn't go to the 8th floor (that's Malestrazza's quarters, you see, and it's never cleaned), and whatever you do don't go on the roof! I would think that someone planning the demolition of a building would explain the logical deficiency of avoiding certain parts of it, but we understand that this is a horror movie and these goofy rules he's explaining are a set-up for freaky sequences that are to follow. There's also the issue of a few remaining people who lived in the building and who are not likely to appreciate Sam arriving to destroy it. The young boy also worries that Malestrazza will be offended by her plans.I was reminded of the brilliant novel House of Leaves in a lot of things about the movie. Sam discovers enormous discrepancies between the blueprints and the actual measurements of the house, which in that book led to a fascinating and frightening series of events, but in the movie leads to the cheap and utterly witless third act. There is also a lot of throwbacks to Psycho in the relationship between the young boy and his mother in an isolated location. Sam even describes the building as being ""like the Bates Motel, only bigger,"" and at one point the mother forbids her son to go near Sam, telling him that Sa could never take care of him the way she does. Creepy.Ultimately we learn about an ""ancient architectural belief"" that provides the reason that Malestrazza killed people and walled them into his buildings (and also the reason why not one of the 27 buildings that Malestrazza built have ever been torn down). It gives the movie the feel of something with more thought in it that it actually has. I felt a little flicker of interest when this was revealed, but in retrospect it strikes me as little more than a screenwriters brainstorm. I understand that Walled In is based on a novel, and I hope the novel is better than the movie. Books, especially horror books, are always better than the movie, ad if someone read the book and thought it was good enough to make into a film, it must have been better than this movie, because it has all the sign-posts of a weak horror film. It's full to the brim with cheap scares (notice the Screeching Cat Scare, which at least was made a little bit different but essentially is the same old thing, and my favorite, a scary rose scare. You have to see that one to believe it) and blatantly rips off a whole series of other horror movies. I'm curious what the movie would have looked like had director Gilles Paquet-Brenner never seen Psycho, Texas Chainsaw, and the Nightmare on Elm Street films. He even uses that ""One, Two, Freddy's Coming For You"" song several times. Real creative there, buddy.I won't go into the details of the end of the film partly because I don't want to ruin it for you but mostly because it's so dumb that I don't want to bother spending my time explaining it. I will tell you one thing though. There's a particularly amusing scene where the boy accuses Samantha of thinking that he's nothing but a ""crazy little boy."" You gotta see this scene, man, it's hilarious. At the time that he says that to her, I won't tell you what he happens to be doing, but when you make a statement like that, it's generally not a good time to be acting like a crazy little boy. What follows that scene is a third act that is not entirely without effect, but definitely one of the dumbest situations that I've seen in a horror movie in some years. It is so bizarre and makes so little sense that the movie almost becomes a mystery. Another mystery is why the thing got made in the first place, but sadly, after seeing the movie, I don't think I'm every going to be able to bring myself to read the book",4
16,7,"Could Have Been a Good Movie, but...","I had high hopes for this movie after seeing the trailer. This could have been a good movie, but... The production team seemed to have run out of money, and then had to wrap it up really fast half way through, causing a hasty and staggering series of quick shots with ""one-take"" scenes. This, obviously, made the actors look bad and that's a shame. They did a good job at the beginning of the film. The first 20-30 minutes of the movie is actually pretty good, but I'll save you the time by saying that it went downhill FAST. I'll give you perspective that the budget of a film means nothing to me. Sure, I love the special effects that make the big-budget films soar and help tell the story, but I like the low-budget, indie films just as well, provided it tells a good story. This film has neither. When they started to rush, they lost the viewer by getting off track, and seemingly changing the actual story line, making it confusing, wobbly-paced, and completely destroying the story. Not intense, not scary, not interesting. Save your time and enjoy a good indie thriller or a big-budget film that you've yet to see.",3
23,8,Bravo,"I seldom watch Myanmar Movies as Myanmar celebrities seems either poorly or overacting; plots are simple, predictable and unreasonable. But as this movie became a success, I thought I should taste the movie as well.

23,1,"It's a better movie, yet it's okay.","I don't like long review, so, I'm going to make it short.
Firstly, most of the Myanmar/Burmese movies are so boring as almost all movies are dramas. So, it's so boring.
Secondly, the actors and actresses are very bad. Most of actors aren't good at acting. When I watch Myanmar movies, I can feel that they are acting, not happening naturally. You know what I mean. So, I think I don't need to explain it more.
So, here's my rating and review part.
As it is a drama, the first 30 mins (approximately) is so boring. They are building the plot, and it's turning into drama, so, very boring. I give it a star only.
The story is quite simple and predictable. So, it's a star.
As I've stated in the above, the Myanmar/Burmese actors are very bad at acting. When I watch them act, I can always feel they are acting and the movie is a movie. When actors and actresses are very good, it's like you are seeing whatever happens in the movie in front of you. It will not give the feeling of watching a movie. The actors and actresses can't be compared with American actors, yet, they improved a lot. Yet, I still feel that they are acting. So, I'll just give a star for that reason.
Although the movie isn't that much good or great, whatever you have on your mind, the cinematography is pretty good. So, two stars for it.
So, all in all, it doesn't deserve to have 10 stars from me yet. They still needs to improve not only their actings but also the quality that requires for a movie to become a really great one.",5
25,5,"Weird, Wonderful, Sexy Elektra","This movie, several steps up from ""Women In Trouble"" in terms of consistency, further evolves the weird, wonderful and sexy world of the title character. Carla Gugino is so winning as this confused but sometimes wise former lady of porn that it makes you wonder what movies would be like if she got more leading parts. Returning from the first one are the awesome duo of Adrienne Palicki and Emmanuelle Chriqui, who are maybe the most moving part of the story. Joseph Gordon Levitt is hilarious in it too and Malin Akerman, who I wasn't all that keen on from ""Watchmen"", actually proves she's a very good actress. Sex-positive and lesbian-positive without being preachy or sappy, this is a smart, weird comedy with a ton of personality and GREAT DIALOGUE.",9
25,8,"""Elektra Luxx"" is a fun and enjoyable film with great performances all around.","On March 14th in Austin, TX, I headed into the World Premiere of ""Elektra Luxx"" at the Paramount Theater and boy was I in for a treat. I was so pumped just being at SXSW but sitting a few seats away from me were Malin Akerman, Carla Gugino, Emma Bell, Emmanuelle Chriqui, and director/writer Sebastian Gutierrez. About an hour into the film, the worst thing that could ever happen to a director happened...the movie screen went blank during the world premiere. Within a few minutes, Sebastian Gutierrez appeared on stage doing a one man show entertaining the audience to the highest level possible. After about 20 mins, the cast came on stage to help fill the time. This is when my brilliant ass decided to ask the most awkward question to ask a filmmaker period, let alone during a chaotic screening. I began to ask ""how do you make a sequel to a film that no one saw the original of?"" After that sentence came out of my mouth, I actually felt really bad for asking it because I didn't realize how harsh it sounded but luckily for me Sebastian Gutierrez decided to answer it honestly and poke fun at me a bit in the process. The guy is awesome. I have met a ton of directors and celebrities and he ranks up there as the coolest guy I met in showbiz. He just seemed like the kind of guy who really valued his fans and I truly admire the man now. But as the 45 minute mark drew near, Janet Pierson let everyone know we would not be able to see the ending of ""Elektra Luxx"" tonight as the projector could not be fixed.About two weeks ago, I was browsing online and came across the Gen Art Film Festival and to my surprise ""Elektra Luxx"" was playing at the festival. I knew I had to get tickets and surely enough just a few days later I did. So finally on Friday April 9, 2010...I entered the theater took my seat right across from Mr. Gutierrez again and shortly the film began...""Elektra Luxx"" is the sequel to the film, ""Women in Trouble."" For the most part, this film focuses around the life of ""Elektra Luxx (played by the beautiful and very talented Carla Gugino) and her retirement from the porn industry. In the film, Elektra is trying to just live a normal life by teaching a class called ""How to have sex like a porn star."" Shortly into the film, her past comes back to haunt her as she gets a surprise visit from Cora (Marley Shelton) who has some information about her husband. The film only continues to get more interesting as it goes along.. A lot of laughs and some dramedy filled moments ensue...""Elektra Luxx"" has a cast of some of the most beautiful women in showbiz and surprisingly all of them are great actresses as well. Carla Gugino's lead role as Elektra is not only fun but a very good performance. Her character isn't as simple as you may think and Gugino plays the role with such passion that you just enjoy every moment she is on screen. Marley Shelton plays Cora and is very good even though she has very limited screen time. Emmanuelle Chriqui is always pleasure to watch as Bambi. Her role of playing the all business & no fun girl perfectly offsets her partner in crime Holly Rocket played by Adrianne Palicki. Holly Rocket is is my favorite character in the film as well as the funniest. She seems dumb on the surface but if you actually pay attention to her character, she really isn't and that's what I love about it. Joseph Gordon Levitt is great in the film as Burt Rodriguez. Levitt steals the show every moment he is on screen. Malin Akerman's character Trixie isn't in the film all that much but for what little screen time she has, her character looks like it's going to show some promise in the next film. Overall, everyone does an amazing job even the host of people I haven't listed but these are the main ones.Sebastian Gutierrez pulled a ""Woody Allen"" so to speak and directed, wrote, and produced the film. He is truly great at doing all of those things. I guess having done a lot of writing for ""Mainstream Hollywood"" it is nice to see him create something more independent. After having seen two different Q&A sessions with Sebastian, I would have to say that he is one of my most driven and passionate directors in the biz. He loves film and he loves his cast and it truly shows. One thing I have to mention is that everyone in the cast pointed out was that Sebastian treats everyone like family and that shows. These films ""Women in Trouble"" and ""Elektra Luxx,"" are his babies and while some may not appreciate them for what they are, I really enjoy the films thus far and can't wait to see the final chapter ""Women in Ecstasy"" next year. Great Job Sebastian! I applaud you and support your work. I would love to be in or work on one of your films one day.Bottom Line: ""Elektra Luxx"" isn't for everyone and with that being said you have to have a good appreciation for fun independent films in order to appreciate the film. Horny guys seeing this film hoping to see a lot of sex will surely be disappointed. This movie is very much a character driven film that tells a lot of interesting stories. There are a lot of laughs to be had but also quite a few heartfelt moments thrown in as well. ""Elektra Luxx"" is a movie that is definitely geared towards a mature and smart audience. It has a beautiful and talented cast and I highly recommend it.MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""Elektra Luxx"" is a 9/10.",9
25,3,Almodovar in America,"I would bet that Sebastian Gutierrez, the writer and director of ""Elektra Luxx"" is a big fan of the acclaimed Spanish director Pedro Almodovar. ""Elektra Luxx"" is kind of like an American version of a Almodvar film. It is full of funny, quirky and sexy characters.I don't typically like most mainstream comedies but I really liked this film so that might say more about me than it does about this film. I was laughing out loud throughout the whole thing. The humor doesn't seemed forced like mainstream comedy. It is the characters that make it funny.There is not much of a plot but I enjoyed the time I spent with these characters. My only complaint is that I had to watch it on DVD because the BlueRay is not available yet. Hopefully it comes out soon.Make sure to watch to the ends of the credits. There is a trailer for the final Elekta Luxx film at the end that you will not want to miss.""Elektra Luxx"" is not a movie for everyone. In fact, it is not a movie for most people. If you like eclectic, quirky, sexy films, you should give it a try. You might be pleasantly surprised.",10
25,1,story disintegrates,"Bert Rodriguez (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a fast-talking self-styled porn commentator reporting on 90s porn star Elektra Luxx (Carla Gugino) from his mother's basement. She is famous for a porn with herself as twins but she actually has a twin in prison for real. She is pregnant and out of the business. She's teaching sex class in the community center. Cora (Marley Shelton) admits killing her baby daddy Nick while having sex with him. Cora gives her songs written by Nick about her. In return, Cora wants her to seduce her fiancÃ©e Ben (Justin Kirk) to even the score. She tries to accommodate but he wrongly mistakes robber Dellwood Butterworth (Timothy Olyphant) for him. Holly Rocket (Adrianne Palicki) is a former porn partner who is in love with her best friend Bambi Lindberg (Emmanuelle Chriqui).This is the sequel to 'Women in Trouble'. It tries to be campy with Joseph Gordon-Levitt. It tries to be an irreverent take on porn. I'm willing to go with this weirdness for another Sebastian Gutierrez episode. However it becomes rambling messy story. It has no flow. Its quirkiness is not actually funny. The first movie has a certain charm which this one seems to struggle to maintain. I still like Adrianne Palicki and Emmanuelle Chriqui together. Carla Gugino starts out fine but goes downhill. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is too broad and I grow to hate his part of the movie.",3
36,1,Clean and scrappy...,"It is true that there are parody elements in George Marshall's delightful ""Destry Rides Again"" but the real humor lies not so much in these sorts of antics, nor the heavily laid on inquiries of Marlene Dietrich as to the tastes of the backroom boys, but rather in James Stewart's no-gun Destry characterizationÂ… This springs from the same source as Ford's 'characters', recognizable frontier independent-minded eccentrics, with a firm footing in American literature; characters often with a roundabout way of making a point, or pointing a moral, as with Destry's habit of prefacing each little cautionary parable with: 'I knew a fellow once whoÂ…' A habit that inevitably drew the aggrieved riposte: 'You know too many fellows, DestryÂ…'The other 'characters' in this film have more than a color or two of parodyÂ—Mischa Auer's improbable Slavonic cowboy, Charles Winninger's town drunk, Brian Donlevy, unprincipled boss, and Samuel S. Hinds' nicely played judgeÂ…In retrospect, it's odd how much this movie gains from its rather touching little postscriptÂ… Stewart, the unconventional lawman, having pacified his cowtown, strolls the streets with a hero-worshiping lad at his heels, and yet also takes a little cloud of sadness along with himÂ…Marshall's film is considered a classic Western which manages to encompass suspense, comedy, romance, tenderness, vivid characterization, horseplay, songs and standard western excitements, without moving for more than a moment from a studio main street setÂ… Hollywood expertise at its very best...",8
36,2,Absolutely cracking Western spoof with great performances from Stewart and Dietrich,"DESTRY RIDES AGAIN is set in the hopelessly corrupt little town of Bottleneck, presided over as it is by the ruthless land-grabber and card shark Kent (Brian Donlevy) and his sexy partner-in-crime Frenchy (Marlene Dietrich). Sheriffs don't last long in this town, particularly since Mayor Slade (Samuel S. Hinds) is in cahoots with Kent and his flock of flunkies. After doing away with Sheriff Keyhole, Slade appoints the hapless town drunk, Washington Dimsdale (Charles Winninger), to be the new Sheriff. 'Wash' cleans up his act and hopes to re-enact the past glory he had under his boss Sheriff Destry, by calling in Destry's son Tom (James Stewart) to be his deputy. To his horror, Tom is a mild-mannered kind of guy, tall and gangling but with a tendency to lapse into little stories of people he knows. Even worse, Tom has an aversion to guns (his father having been shot in the back in spite of being well-known for going about guns a-blazing) and takes out his frustrations by carving, of all things, napkin rings. It doesn't seem likely that 'Wash' is going to clean up Bottleneck with a deputy like Tom, but clean it up they will, with the aid of Frenchy, who falls quickly for Tom, and henpecked comic wannabe cowboy Boris (Mischa Auer) who is appointed second deputy. The film is truly a great ride from beginning to end, thoroughly engaging, funny, and yet touching as well. You're never quite sure what to expect, but whatever it is, you're never disappointed. First of all, you don't get stock characters--Tom Destry is as atypical a Western hero as you can get, as he wanders down the streets of Bottleneck carving napkin rings and using charm instead of guns (most of the time!) to get things done his way. Secondly, as can be expected from a hero who doesn't believe in guns, there aren't all that many scenes of gunplay. Oh sure, there's a pretty cool shoot-out at the end, but that's quickly foiled by Frenchy's clever marshalling of the women of Bottleneck, and you get the impression from the film that stock action scenes with plenty of guns and bodies falling from incredible heights just aren't the point of DESTRY RIDES AGAIN, and that's a point in its favour. Finally, there isn't a pat Hollywood ending either. There's a happy ending, of course, but it's bittersweet. I was fully expecting Frenchy and Tom to get together at the very end, cue fadeout etc. etc. They *do* get together, that goes without saying. But again, this occurs in a way that one simply doesn't expect (right until it actually happens). This film always keeps you guessing, but also continually entertained.You really couldn't get a better or more appropriate cast than this one too... of the supporting cast, Charles Winninger plays his bumbling, half-drunk but principled character of Town Drunk/Sheriff Dimsdale perfectly. Mischa Auer, as well, is endearing as Boris, from when he loses his pants to Frenchy on a bet, through to his determination to be a great second deputy sheriff in exchange for Tom Destry's extra pants. But the two leads are fabulous as well: the top-billed Marlene Dietrich is sultry, sexy but also cute, and performs some great numbers in the saloon (the best of which would be 'The Boys In The Back Room', but the opener 'Little Joe' would be a close runner-up). Still, the one thing Dietrich will be remembered for from this film, and with good cause, is *that* bar-room catfight with Una Merkel (who plays Lily Belle). Catty, vicious and absolutely hilarious, Dietrich really goes all out in a slap-down knock-out fight with Merkel, then proceeds to throw everything imaginable in Stewart's direction with such fire and enthusiasm that you can't help laughing at and loving her at the same time. Speaking of Stewart--he gives a fantastic performance in the role of Thomas Jefferson Destry. His laidback way of ambling across the screen, his slow assured drawl, his expressive face all combine together to bring Destry to life. It isn't any actor who can pull off the apparent humiliation Stewart's character must face, such as descending from his carriage to face the folk of Bottleneck for the first time carrying a canary cage and a parasol over his head. But just as he pulls off the comedic scenes, his dramatic scenes are effective as well, particularly his final scenes with both Washington and Frenchy. Most importantly, you can believe that Tom is a good-natured charmer, as he's meant to be, but not a simple-minded dolt.
DESTRY RIDES AGAIN isn't just an absolutely cracking Western (from its bar-room brawls and sassy ladies right down to its grand shootout finale)--it's also a sly, tongue-in-cheek homage to and spoof of the entire genre and its stock of characters, from the roguish ne'er-do-well (Kent) to the bumbling sheriff (Washington Dimsdale). It's a feel-good film with romance, comedy and action blended into a Western setting, and is most certainly one of the best films of the 1930s, and one of the best I've ever seen. A classic!",10
36,7,I once had a friend that...,"James Stewart is Destry and he is called by the ex-drunk sheriff to bring law and order to the town of Bottleneck. Brian Donlevy is the bad guy who runs the town and Marlene Dietrich runs the saloon. Destry is a very, very low key guy, and the whole fun of the film is how he surprises the townÂ´s people by turning up to be the opposite of what they think he is. Dietrich has a few great musical numbers and she brings a lot to the film. But the most fun is really Stewart, whenever he wants to make a statement he gives as an example several fictitious friends, after a while they all know it is a lie, but still keep listening. You can see this film a hundred times and still enjoy it.",10
36,3,No Promiscuous Shooting In Bottleneck,"1939 that celebrated high point of the Hollywood studio system turned out to be the break out year for James Stewart. His career kicked into high gear with Destry Ridges Again and Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. From just a good leading man these films guaranteed Jimmy Stewart screen immortality.Destry was equally an important film for Marlene Dietrich. Her career had come to a standstill and she had been let go from her original American studio, Paramount. A whole lot of people said she was through in Hollywood, but Marlene showed them all.This is the second film adaption of the story, a 1932 version was done by Tom Mix, one of his last films and one of his few sound ones. This one however is THE standard version.Destry Rides Again was directed by George Marshall who was very good at mixing humor and drama to make some great films. This one is probably Marshall's greatest. Among Hollywood directors from the studio age, he is sadly forgotten. The town of Bottleneck is one rip roaring place with a whole lot of promiscuous shooting going on. It's a pretty corrupt place run by saloon owner Brian Donlevy and his stooge mayor Samuel S. Hinds. When the sheriff is killed they 'elect' the town drunk Charles Winninger as the new sheriff.But Winninger who was a deputy sheriff at one time sends for the son of his former boss Thomas Jefferson Destry played by Jimmy Stewart. Destry makes quite an entrance into Bottleneck, running afoul of saloon entertainer Marlene Dietrich. His arrival in Bottleneck up to his first encounter with Marlene are some of the funniest moments ever put on screen.Destry Rides Again gave Marlene one of her classic ballads, See What the Boys in the Backroom Will Have as well as Little Joe, the Wrangler. Who would ever have thought that the girl from Germany would wind up having one of her most noted film roles as a western saloon entertainer. But Marlene created an indelible character, so much so that Mel Brooks and Madeline Kahn gave her a real heartfelt tribute in Blazing Saddles. I'll bet Marlene enjoyed that one also.James Stewart did not return to the western genre until Winchester 73 and Broken Arrow eleven years later. But this was one great film to make a debut in that film art form.You won't indulge in any promiscuous shooting while Destry is on the job.",10
47,2,If Elvis Presley were a mariachi?,"Looking to kill some time, I took a chance on this title. I'd heard nothing about it (and I follow movies more than most people do), but was drawn by -- of all things -- the presence of Tom Arnold in the cast. And I think Tom Arnold has a very likable screen presence.Well, Tom Arnold is there, and his character possesses the qualities I enjoy; but he is not the reason to see ""Pulling Strings."" Rather enjoy it as a romantic comedy with a thriller element, filled with interesting characters and set in what is for most Americans an exotic, if relatable, setting. The leads and supporting characters are all attractive, amusing, or both. (To Yanks, the other familiar actor is Stockard Channing). It goes where you'd expect it to, but with some unexpected side trips.The lead character's job as a mariachi is played up; he performs several songs throughout the picture, all part of the story-telling. I kept thinking of this as what a really nice Elvis Presley movie might have looked like.If any of this or the other reviews sounds even remotely interesting, please give ""Pulling Strings"" a shot (or a stream). It's not going to change cinema, but I preferred to any number of other recent comedies. Now, I'm off to see if I can find any background on the producers",8
47,3,Beautiful love story!,"I am shocked at low rating on IMDb. I don't usually dish out high ratings easily so for me this was a winner hands down. I have been hoping to see a movie that is entertaining, sweet, romantic and fun, and this was all of that and more. For anyone who is an immigrant to US the movie will bring back some memories. The moment of ""Yay"" vs. ""Nay"" when facing the immigration officer is stressful and memorable one for most. That however is just the premise to launch into some sweet and fun comedic adventure. I wish there was more of a pleasant culture shock highlighted in the movie. Yeah the people were nice and Tostadas from a small stand were good, and common use of Mariachis was fun, but there could have been many more opportunities to endear the audience to best of Mexico's culture. The way people interact there was captured beautifully. People were not as uptight and bit more warm and friendly. Friends would do anything for each other, and how with little that some have, how much more happy they can be with that than so many people who have lot more and aren't. None of this was specifically highlighted, but was there to see for anyone paying attention.In the end movie is just an excuse for romantic, cute, comedic love story and it delivers completely satisfying and enjoyable experience.The best moment for me was the senior couple sitting next to me in the movie theater. When in the end, the Hero is begging the girl for another chance, couple sitting next to me answered in unison with an emphatic ""yes"" with both hands extended towards the screen! If this movie can't find a place in audiences hearts, then we have a problem....and it is not the movie!",9
47,5,A fun film!,"I saw Pulling Strings today, knowing little about it and having seen no trailers. It sounded like something I'd enjoy, and I did. The male and female leads give pitch perfect performances; you'll know right away they are made for each other. The male lead (a single dad with an adorable young daughter) has a very funny sidekick - you'll love the sound effect his car makes. The female lead has a fun ""buddy,"" too.The story is set in Mexico City. It begins at the immigration window at the US Embassy and takes off from there. A missing laptop is a major plot point. Mariachi music is another. I loved the romantic elements in the movie and the comic elements made me laugh out loud many times. All of the characters are wonderful.This is a great ""date night"" movie, but obviously, singles will like it, too. I had a ball. One more thing: Much of the dialogue is in Spanish with subtitles, but please, please, don't let that put you off. You'll have great fun watching Pulling Strings!",7
47,6,A crazy but thoroughly enjoyable ride.,"After the death of his wife, a promising singer's career is put on hold as he tries to cope with the loss and take care of his young daughter, Maria. Depressed and not believing he is doing enough for his daughter, Alejandro (Jaime Camil) decides to send her to her grandparents in the United States. Unfortunately when he goes to get a visa at the US Embassy his application is rejected by an unsympathetic embassy employee, Rachel (Laura Ramsey), who meticulously follows the rules for granting visas, leaving Alejandro out in the cold. Bitter, Alejandro blames Rachel, who he complains 'wouldn't even look at him,' for all his troubles.Rachel, who is about to accept a promotion to a position in London, is shocked when her colleagues throw her a going away party that night. With his career in the dumpster, Alejandro is relegated to playing in a mariachi band, and is shocked when he finds himself playing for Rachel at the going away party. Inspired by the chance meeting he decides he's been given a second chance to get his visa, so he concocts a complicated plan to gain Rachel's favor.Although Alejandro's scheme is a bit over the top, he takes Rachel on such an enchanting ride that she can't help but rethink her feelings about Mexico and Alejandro. Although Rachel is rather naive for a diplomat, she is refreshingly honest and trusting which paints her as anything but a cold-hearted American. Strong performances by Jaime Camil, Laura Ramsey and Omar Shaparro brought this heart-warming romantic comedy to life and made it a thoroughly enjoyable experience.",7
58,2,William Castle Presents Joan Crawford In EMOTE-O-RAMA,"Like all William Castle films, the story of STRAIT-JACKET is slight, full of holes, and often silly to the point of absurdity. Long ago Joan Crawford came home to find her husband in bed with a floozie and snatched up an ax. Adjudged insane, she is locked up in an asylum for twenty years, but now she's home--and pretty soon some really weird things begin to happen around the old family farm. Could it be, oh, I don't know... JOAN? Throughout his career, producer-director William Castle liked to build his movies around gimmicks: TINGLER had ""Percepto,"" 13 GHOSTS had ""Illusion-O,"" and HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL had ""Emergo."" But STRAIT-JACKET had something better: Joan Crawford herself, who plays in a style that can only be described as ""Emote-O-Rama."" Say what you like about Crawford, she never gave any performance less than one hundred percent, and in STRAIT-JACKET she gives one hundred and fifty. In the opening scenes, 60-something Joan has the unmitigated gall to play Lucy in her 20s! Later, as Lucy in her 40s, Joan plays the role like a nice little old lady who occasionally drops acid: when she's not busy with her nervous breakdown, she sucks down bourbon, attempts to seduce her daughter's boyfriend (even to the point of putting her fingers in his mouth), knits like a fiend, lights a cigarette by striking a match on a record album, raises hell at a dinner party... and all of it about as subtle as a bulldozer.But they didn't call her a star for nothing: not only does Crawford manage to carry it off with complete conviction, she actually manages to endow the character with considerable pathos along the way. And I have absolutely no doubt that THIS was the film Faye Dunaway studied the most when preparing to play Crawford in the infamous MOMMIE DEAREST; watch both back-to-back and you'll know exactly what I mean.The rest of the cast is pretty interesting as well, featuring Diane Baker as daughter Carol, Leif Erickson as Crawford's brother, George Kennedy as an unsavory farmhand, and a very young Lee Majors as the ill-fated husband--not to mention Mitchell Cox, a Pepsi V.P. Joan was favoring at the time. There are cheap special effects (amazing, how she can neatly lop off a head or two with a single blow), Pepsi-Cola product placements, and even some dialogue that would do Ed Woods proud. It's all campy and bizarre and hilariously weird and ramped up to the nth degree by Crawford's full-force performance.With a somewhat better script and production values, STRAIT-JACKET could easily have matched Bette Davis' more sophisticated HUSH, HUSH SWEET CHARLOTTE; as it stands, however, it is a cult movie in all caps. The DVD release is very nicely done, with the film itself in excellent condition. A collection of Crawford's costume tests gives a surprising insight to actress' personality, and a particularly nice little making-of documentary includes comments from Diane Baker. (Note: don't watch the documentary, called ""Battle-Ax,"" until after you've seen the film: it's a spoiler.) Strongly recommended to Castle, Cult, and Crawford fans! Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",7
58,3,You can't afford to miss Straight Jacket.,"The movie opens with shocking betrayal.  Lucy Harbin (Joan Crawford) returns from a journey only to find her husband (Lee Majors) in bed with another woman.  She spins into a murderous rampage.  With an axe, she evens the score by lopping of the heads of her adulterous husband and his mistress with a big, shiny axe.  Her revenge is the fuel for local legend, but the price is twenty years in a mental intuition.When Crawford is released from custody (fully recovered) the story begins.
The prison bus drops Crawford off at the home of her sweet and innocent daughter, who is very popular and happens to be dating the richest boy in town.  She also watched as her mother brutally murdered two people, including her father,  but in spite of life's little setbacks, Diane Harbin is perfectly fine.With such a humdrum cast of characters, it seems strange when headless corpses start showing up all over town.  Who could the murderer be?This movie is one of the five best movies I saw in 2003. It's lots of fun, and Crawford's performance outclasses any I've seen.   It is a GREAT movie. It's got LOTS of decapitations, but no gore or fake blood!   A modern marvel!",10
58,7,Who says Castle couldn't direct?!?,"This is one of the most enjoyable horror films ever.  The closing credits gag reveals the spirit of the picture - it is not to be taken seriously.  By the way don't spoil a great laugh by reading what that gag is, in the ""crazy credits"" section.  This is pure camp fun, played brilliantly by Joan Crawford in an Oscar worthy performance.  The opening narration is hilarious - and Joan's get-up (black fright wig, clinging floral dress and clanging bangles) is outrageous.  You'll probably guess the surprise ending - but that's not what this film is about.  Besides the fun element there is also a subversive political statement - Castle sets his axe-murder horror on a sweet little farm, that looks like a set from a family sit-com.  And the family that live in it are too good to be true as well.  But all this is a facade, as insanity, lust and murder lie just below the surface.Also of note in the cast are George Kennedy - excellent as the twisted handy-man, and Diane Baker as the perfect daughter.  And apparently that's Lee Majors being hacked up at the start of the film.  Castle does a brilliant directing job, but it's Joan's film all the way - what she can do with knitting and matches is truly amazing!  And the scene where she attempts to seduce her daughter's boyfriend is nothing short of magic.  I can't believe that an actress who could play this scene with such good humour, could have taken herself as seriously as ""Mommie Dearest"" suggests. Do not miss this over-looked classic.",6
58,1,''The Best In Axe-ploitation!'',"No matter what script she was given to do, Joan Crawford was a pro. In this William Castle classic, she proves it again. The plot has been rehashed in previous reviews, so I can get to the heart of the matter here. Joan plays an ex-axe murderess with typical fury, beautifully combined with a poignancy which may be completely unexpected, but nevertheless completely appropriate. Well supported by the underrated Diane Baker, Leif Erikson, Rochelle Hudson and George Kennedy, she gives meaning and depth to what otherwise would have been just another horror film. Whether playing scenes with daughter Baker's boyfriend (John Anthony Hayes) or his snobbish parents, (Howard St, John and Edith Atwater), Crawford is on the money, using her years of experience to transcend her material. Thanks to her, ""Strait-Jacket"" is a worthy thriller from a Legendary Star and a fondly remembered director. See Castle's other collaboration with Joan, ""I Saw What You Did"" (1965). It's a winner, too!",8
62,6,"Great cast, great script","RKO doesn't get the high praise for its westerns that, for example, Paramount does, but its Tom Keene series deserves very high marks.""Renegades"" is an excellent film, with a superb cast, remarkably good dialogue, and even music directed by Max Steiner, later to win much fame for ""Gone With The Wind"" and ""King Kong,"" among many others. (He didn't write much for this series, but placed the music well and appropriately.) Tom Keene was a good actor who should have gone on to more fame and glory. The script writers didn't just quickly throw together a bunch of clichÃ©s.The directing was good -- in fact, it was by Casey Robinson, more famed as a scriptwriter of several classic movies, such as ""Casablanca"" and ""Kings Row.""The entire cast was likable and talented.

62,7,Amusing Eccentric RKO B Western,"Tom Keene wanders into town in a black hat in this one. He gets a job with Rockcliffe Fellowes claiming acquaintance of a jailbird, charms Betty Furness, changes his hat, adopts a baby and finally gets around to why he's in town in this amusing, eccentric B Western.Casey Robinson was finishing up a couple of years of directing Bs before he headed back to his writer's desk, and he fills this one-hour second feature with eccentric character actors. Mr. Keene plays the reluctant hero amusingly. Miss Furness appears in her screen debut; her part had been cut out of another picture, and she would continue as an adornment at RKO with few lines; here, stuttering Doctor Roscoe Ates has to speak her lines for her!",6
69,9,Not Great But Entertaining,"""In the Cold Light of Day"" is no ""Bourne Identity"". It has something of a made-for-TV look to it. At one point while watching, I was reminded of the 80s action/espionage type films sometimes directed by the likes of Lucio Fulci (Contraband, 1980) or Ruggero Deodato (Cut & Run, 1985). I suspect ""In the Cold Light of Day"" will look as bad in 20-odd years as those earlier films look today. OK, this film is somewhat better production values-wise (but lighter on the Italians' trademark violence), but it still has that Euro-American co-production 'el cheapo' look to it.Nonetheless, it is, as my review heading states, quite entertaining. It plods along amiably enough for much of its length until the film's highlight, around 16 minutes from the end: a very well executed and imaginative car chase sequence. It's pretty long, well-shot (as is much of the film, incidentally), includes several creative elements, and is fast-paced and pays off well. It's one of the best car chases this reviewer recalls seeing in quite a while.I suppose a score of 6 out of 10 is quite generous for a mediocre film such as this, but it does reflect the entertainment value this reviewer enjoyed.",6
69,3,A bad TV movie,"I went to see this film after I saw an initial rating on here of 8 out of 10, but let me tell you it is very, very poor.The film is littered with blatant product placement to the point that I thought at some points I was watching a slick advert. The first of these adverts is when the film lead stops to buy a drink of coke for no reason and proceeds to slowly drink it with the can taking up most of the screen, really just like an advert.This was a little annoying but I kept hope that this was a small issue in what could become a very good film. Unfortunitly it didn't and car and phone adverts continued through the film. The script was poor and events unbelievable. Most of the action scenes you will have seen copied from Bourne or other action movies but made laughably similar but much worse. The acting from weaver was poor, although I am not sure if the blame lies with sigourney or the director. To be honest Bruce Willis is by far the best actor and carries the film for the first 20min giving some hope it will become a good action film, unfortunately it did not.I have never walked out on a film but after a number of laugh out loud moments ( at the film ), I was seriously contemplating it. I may be wrong but i think we have a nomination for a rotten tomato award.3 stars is being kind,",3
69,8,4.8,"I have to disagree with the bourne analogy.I just don't see it ,after watching the movie I felt it went in a bit of a different direction and I actually thought the movie was entertaining,and cavill seemed unaware for the most part what was going on.Was it a blockbuster,or huge like the bourne's ? No.But it had merit and I am I admit,a little into cavill,and think he is on the rise.the thing is though,is that they are doing a lot of movies along this same line.Still,all in all,though its not great,i wouldn't go so far to say that its not worth a watch.There may be a few mistakes and oddities in the show,but still it kept my attention to the end.the storyline seems to lack here and there,but I guess I still think it turns out to be a fairly good watch.",7
69,5,Don't bother.... it's a waste of time.,"If you've seen the Bourne Trilogy, and then you go and see this - you're going to be severely disappointed. It's like a poor man's version! This film tries to be everything that the Bourne series was - but fails spectacularly. Every element of this film that comes together to make the whole - is worthy of criticism. The storyline is amateurish. When you get to the end of the film, you recollect what you've just seen and think to yourself - man there were so many far fetched scenes and wholly unnecessary ones - but then again, if plot didn't contain them, there'd be no film! I'm sorry to be so vague, but this film was put together like a recipe. The writer must have asked himself - what do I need to put into an action/thriller to make it worthy of that genre? Got all the elements together, and mashed them together hastily to produce this utter waste of time. You're left devoid of any satisfaction by the time you reach the end. Just don't watch it and save yourself some money. Rent it on DVD, you'll thank me later.",2
70,7,Above average study of small time Irish American thieves.,"'Noose' (a.k.a. 'Snitch') is a movie that sneaks up on you. I stumbled across it almost by accident and watched it mainly because of the cast. The late Ted Demme directed, and personally I enjoyed this more than his better known 'Blow'. It contains a few dull spots but overall, it's a pretty interesting and effective look at small time crooks and their attitudes towards family and loyalty. Denis Leary once again proves he has some genuine talent as an actor, not just as a comedian. He basically makes this movie, though Ian Hart ('Backbeat') is also very good. Leary's co-star in 'Jesus Son' Billy Crudup appears in a small supporting role. It's a pity they didn't share more on screen time together because they make a memorable duo, as anyone who has seen 'Jesus Son' will agree. Colm Meaney ('Con Air') makes an intimidating bad guy, and Famke Janssen ('X-Men') is not only astonishingly beautiful but she is also believable as a troubled local caught between Leary and Meaney. It was also good to see the highly underrated John Diehl ('Motorama') as one of Leary's buddies and Martin Sheen ('Badlands') has a nice turn as a frustrated local cop. The cast here is sometimes better than the occasionally predictable script, but on the whole this movie is worth watching. Above average.",8
70,1,A good film about thugs,"The chronicles of soldier level (the lowest level of thugs in the mafia) of the Irish mob gang is directed well by Demme. Although its not flashy, it tells a semi-simple story in a natural and realistic manner. Leary does well in the lead as Bobby O Grady who is a member in Jackie's(Meaney) gang but things go bad when Jackie the boss kills one of Bobby's friends. This film is written well by Mike Armstrong and Denis Leary (uncredited according to IMDb). I liked how Demme went about it, much different from other films i saw of his which were ""Blow"", ""Life"", although in some ways i could see similarities between this and his 96' film ""Beautiful Girls"". After viewing this, i think that Demme was not a bad director, of course not on the level of his uncle Jonathan Demme. Anyhow this film good, if u like mafia or movies about thugs (i do) then u will like this. IMDb rating: 6.3 my rating: 8/10",10
70,6,the code of silence,"I grew up in this town of Charlestown a very strong irish neighborhood people here call themselves townies. The movie Monument Ave. is about the code of silence this town went through. Its very much like it but there were many more murders and alot more police arrests. Boston wanted to break the Irish Catholic clout in Charlestown and open the town up to new cultures, it never happened but since 2000 the town is only 93% Irish-Townie catholic. Monument Ave. was a very good movie and it explained what it was like here but it was much more violent. Charlestown was and still is a very dangerous town. Like in the movie brothers were killing brothers and people killing each other knowing that people would not tell that they did this, sex and drugs was involved in this alot too. Racism and Loyalty and doing inappropriate things like robbing, shooting, stabbing fighting, drinking etc. was a big thing here to. Kids around Charlestown (Townies) made a book about this called The Piece of Peace. There was 149 murders during the code of silence in Charlestown. Monument Ave. is a good explanation of what happened here. Thats what it was really like. Not like ""Southie"" which is nothing compared to Charlestown. But Monument Ave. was an exellent movie!",8
70,8,Monument Avenue really works with it's fine acting and directing,"Monument Avenue is a familiar story that has been done before.  However, this film really works due to the fine acting and directing.  Ted Demme does an outstanding job developing the characters through his his long and sometimes drawn out dialogue scenes.  The cast of Dennis Leary and Famke Janssen are extremely convincing and really make this film better than most of it's kind.  Perhaps the small, almost cameo roles played by stars Billy Crudup, Martin Sheen and Jeanne Tripplehorn are what really make this film worth seeing.  This is a perfect example of how good directing and acting can make a big difference on a common and somewhat predictable script.",8
73,5,So right on what life is!,"This is a simple story on kind people: Jean tries his best to live his life as a good person. When he describes his mason's job, we understand he likes it deeply and is quietly proud of it. His simplicity moves the teacher and the watchers. She invites him to see a problematic window in her flat. This change of window is like a symbol of what will be happening to them: Jean asks her to play the violin for him, and music will bring him elsewhere, beyond his today's limits -the classical music itself plays an important part, Jean is deeply moved by this discovery too, not only because she is playing the music herself-. This moment is for me a pure beauty. On her side, she is also brought to a new area in her life where there is someone who loves when she plays music, who is eager to learn and to open himself, someone who cares about others and about her: this is building confidence in her and adds a new depth in her interest in people and in life, although we understand there will be pain for both of them!No one wants to hurt any one around! The choice will have to be done and these good people will prefer being hurt themselves than their beloved around. When Jean asks her to accept and play the violin for his father' birthday party, he is so straightforward, so daring for a simple -nearly shy- person, that it seems clear he has reached also a new confidence, he has gone behind the window. We also think about what is exactly loving someone: Jean' wife understands so simply it means letting the other one be happy, grow and develop himself without trying to pressure him and use guilt. She is also building a new confidence in her husband and thus in life... This moment has been a very fulfilling for me: thank you Monsieur Brize!",10
73,4,A sweet sadness,"In StÃ©phane BrizÃ©'s restrained fourth film (which he's adapted from a 1996 Ã‰ric Holder novel) a tight-lipped mason named Jean (Vincent Lindon) in an unnamed provincial French town meets his little boy's schoolteacher, the Mademoiselle of the title (Sandrine Kiberlain) and his world subtly changes. He loves his wife Anne-Marie (Aure Atika), who works in a print shop, and little JÃ©rÃ©my (Arthur Le Houerou), but Mademoiselle (her name is VÃ©ronique, but Jean never gets beyond the formal ""vous"" with her) has a refinement, a delicacy. And she plays the violin -- classical music that Jean seems unfamiliar with but delighted by.At first Mademoiselle asks Jean at the last minute to fill in and speak to her class (and his son's) about his work, an experience that also gives him great pleasure. Perhaps he enjoys indirectly telling this refined maiden lady who attracts him about his basic, satisfying work, building houses that are always different and will last, as one child asks, ""for your whole life."" Then when she asks help with a broken window at her flat, he takes a look and then insists on being the one to replace it. Then comes the music. He insists that she play; photos and the violin tell him of her former profession.This film has only a hint of sex, and no raw physicality, but it works with the body, with silence, and with gesture. Throughout it shows Lindon acting the part by doing hard construction work on screen, breaking up paving with a pneumatic drill, mounting the window, laying bricks of a wall, and so on. He even walks like a skilled laborer. Anne-Marie is always ironing, cooking, shopping, making lists. Mademoiselle Chambon reads, rests, places her hand delicately on her neck. Jean tenderly washes the feet of his old father (charming veteran Jean-Marc Thibault).Finally the teacher plays a recording of chamber music at her place for Jean and as they sit together listening they slowly hold hands, embrace, and cling together as if at home, but afraid to go further. This carefully paced sequence is one of the film's most effective. However many ""make-out"" scenes you may have seen, this one still feels fresh. Lindon is like a fine mason in his acting, slowly, patiently laying the bricks of gesture. A silence and a pause can speak volumes.Both VÃ©ronique and Jean fight their attraction. And can it go anywhere? But it keeps growing, despite gestures in the opposite direction. Jean tells Mademoiselle that her CD's interest him even though he hasn't listened to them yet. She usually changes schools every year, but tells him, in a key scene, that she's been asked to fill in for someone and stay on. But instead of expressing enthusiasm, Jean blurts out that his wife is pregnant.This is one anchor to the family: one child, and another coming. Another is Jean's father. Jean and Anne-Marie are planning a big birthday party for the old man at their house with family members coming from all over. Family matters. But Jean shows how far his feelings have gone in another direction -- even though we've seen only those restrained moments -- when he invites Mademoiselle Chambon to come and play the violin for his father. It's not certain that his wife has suspected anything, but she has noticed that Jean seems bored, indifferent, irritable. And she might suspect why now.What follows is surprising -- agonizingly suspenseful -- and quite familiar. We've seen this kind of story before. We've seen these characters before. But we've rarely seen more delicacy than BizÃ© brings to his treatment of the story, which is haunting in a classic way without feeling in any way retro -- though perhaps the provincial setting was chosen to avoid that, to have events unfold in a place that's less aggressively modern and hip than Paris.Lindon and Kiberlain are husband and wife, though now estranged, which may help explain the magnetic energy in their scenes together. There are plenty of lines here, but there's a distrust of language, together with a touching desire to use it properly. ""I'd like to hear more tunes,"" Jean tells VÃ©ronique. ""Is that right, to say 'tunes'?."" At the outset, JÃ©rÃ©my poses a homework problem to his parents to find the ""direct object"" in a sentence and they haven't a clue, but patiently figure out what this means. BizÃ© is great with the children. Arthur Le Houerou as the son is unfailingly alive and natural; and his classmates are spontaneous and charming (though primed, as classes are) when they excitedly ask Jean about his work.If there is a weakness to the film it's the danger that the differences of class and culture are pelled out a little too clearly. Lindon is a magnificent actor, but as a man with many illustrious relatives and one-time suitor of Princess Caroline of Monaco he is not exactly drawing on personal experience in playing a mason whose father was also a mason. Nonetheless he is for the most part utterly convincing. It's the film itself that plays on broad differences that a screenplay of 90 minutes duration cannot quite adequately delineate. Lindon has a harried, careworn, but solid quality that fits a working man in need of reawakening. Kiberlain seems held inward, decent but tragically needy. You wouldn't know that she's been around the block with the actual Lindon and had a child by him; she could be this uptight maiden lady on the brink of lifelong spinsterhood. There's a sadness about her, a sweet sadness.Opened in mid-October 2009 in Paris, this film is part of the Rendez-Vous with French Cinema at Lincoln Center for 2010. What a contrast with the mad body-presses and adulterous whirlwind of another film in the series, CÃ©dric Kahn's Regret. When it comes to the varieties of love, the French have the bases covered.",9
73,2,The Quiet Ache of Infatuation,"MADEMOISELLE CHAMBON is a delicate, quiet interlude in the life of a construction worker in a little village whose gentle life is momentarily disrupted by the awakening of feelings of infatuation and the aftermath. Based on the novel by Eric Holder and adapted for the screen by Florence Vignon and director StÃ©phane BrizÃ©, this little miracle of a movie is what the French do best - understated appreciation for passing passion in a world of ordinary days. Jean (Vincent Lindon) is a construction worker happily married to Anne-Marie (Aure Atika) and adoring father of young son JÃ©rÃ©my (Arthur Le HouÃ©rou) and loving son of his retired builder father (Jean-Marc Thibault): he spends his hours away from his work tutoring his son with his wife and bathing his father's feet. JÃ©rÃ©my's new schoolteacher is the very reserved but kind VÃ©ronique Chambon (Sandrine Kiberlain, in life the wife of Vincent Lindon!) who requests that Jean speak to her class about his occupation as a builder - an assignment Jean is flattered to accept. The presentation goes well and VÃ©ronique hesitantly asks Jean to repair a window in her home. Jean accepts the job (Anne-Marie thinks it is such a kind gesture that she asks Jean to invite VÃ©ronique to lunch). Jean replaces the window for the quietly reserved and anxious VÃ©ronique, and afterward Jean, noticing that VÃ©ronique plays the violin, requests she play for him a 'tune'. It is obvious that the peripatetic teacher is lonely, and it is also obvious that Jean is struck by the fact that a woman of education and musical talent would pay attention to a simple construction worker. In a weak moment the two exchange a kiss and that kiss alters the manner in which each of these two gentle people react to life. The results of this chance encounter play out in the conclusion of the story, a story so tender and yet so grounded in the realities of life that it takes the viewer by the heart and doesn't let go. The many varying moments of intimacy, whether those moments are between Jean and his son, Jean and his father, Jean and his wife, and Jean with Mademoiselle Chambon, are photographed like paintings by cinematographer Antoine HÃ©berlÃ©. The entire cast is excellent and the performances by the five leading actors are superb. The musical score consists of original music by Ange Ghinozzi with a generous sampling of music by Sir Edward Elgar and others. This frail bouquet of a film appreciates silence, the unspoken word, and the natural emotions of ordinary people living ordinary lives. It is a multifaceted treasure. Grady Harp",10
73,8,Vincent Lindon and Sandrine Kiberlain at their very best.,"I am not a romance films lover. I prefer brutal, thrilled and action movies; not for the squeamish. But this one, totally different, is a masterpiece for me. A real monument of fineness, sensibility and emotion. Kiberlain and Lindon were, not so long ago, a couple in real life. That explains everything on the screen. Some sequences are outsanding.When shy Lindon asks shy Kiberlain to play a disc of HER music, and when they listen to it, side by side, I felt warmth under my skin. An unforgettable moment. Pure emotion. At one hundred per cent.And the sequence at Lindon's father's anniversary, when Kiberlain plays violin, her eyes closed, plunged into her music, her world, her soul. At this moment, Lindon's wife stares at her husband's face, and Kiberlain's one. And she understands. Everything. But keeps this for her.I won't spoil the end of this real gem. But, believe me, all long this story, I felt my eyes wet.",10
74,2,"Bad,bad movie...","This was a bad,bad movie... Completely awful, I don't even know where to begin. I really liked the first one, the story was cool, jokes were excellent, had that Adam Sandler humor going on. But this one - nothing. Absolutely nothing. I haven't had one laugh throughout the whole movie. They've managed to put in,at least 3 minutes long,""farting in the face"" scene on the very beginning of the movie. And it got even worse after that!!! Farting, nuts stuck in the toilet scene, farting,dick in the popcorn scene, farting, boobs, gay jokes, boobs, farting... Such a shame what they did with this movie. You can see that even the actors don't give a damn,they don't even try to make it better. What a nasty way to take people's money! In the end - nothing made any sense, especially why i watched it whole the way through.I just feel more stupid now!I don't recommend it, don't watch it! Better take a two hour nap or something, it will be a time better spent!",6
74,1,I saw this movie for free and I still want a refund,"Now I know why this didn't get a theatrical release. It's full of the worst thing a comedy can have: awkward, dead air. The first was stupid, low-brow humor, but it was really funny. This one made me want to stop watching after twenty minutes. Not only were the jokes not very funny, I feel like there weren't many of them. Most of it was awkward conversations. The movie would also randomly focus on characters other than Joe Dirt, and they weren't funny. You might chuckle a couple times but the humor is nowhere near as consistent as the original.If you liked the first one, don't watch it. If you didn't like the first one, definitely don't watch it. Just don't watch it.",1
74,7,the subtlety and innocence of the character was completely gone.,"The reason I liked the first Joe Dirt a lot was because Joe Dirt was a likable and kind of an innocent character. The first movie had some crass jokes and it had some dark humor in it, but Joe Dirt was always the shinning star of the story. He felt like a real character that was just down on his luck, the humor might have been silly and gross at times but Joe Dirt was still an innocent, Naive, good person looking for his parents. That was the core of the story. A good guy that did not have the best life and wanted to find his family. What do we get here? Just a cynical version of that character.the subtlety of the character is completely gone. This felt more like am actual mean spirited Parody of the first Joe Dirt. there was nothing deeper to this movie than just the jokes and the cameos. Say what you will about the first movie but it at least tried to have a heart underneath all the jokes. What happened to ""Life is a garden, Dig It"" what happened to that? that's my point. This movie felt like if it was written and Directed by Robbie (Kid Rock) from the first one. The same exact thing happened to the Dumb and Dumber sequel and the Vacation sequel. any kind of innocence and naiveness those characters had was replaced by foul humor. Not sure what is happening to comedy anymore. Everything is just loud and obnoxious today.",1
74,4,I'll take it,"It is hard to make a sequel to a movie like Joe Dirt 14 years later. The story of Joe was very much summed up in the 1st film. But the fans wanted more and more is what they got. This movie follows the path of the original. Similar if not the same Jokes. It pays homage to the 1st film giving signature words and phrases from Christopher Walken and David Spade. The production quality is there. The score is there. The cinematography and the color could be better in my opinion but that is just one mans opinion. If I had went and paid to see this film at the theater as I did to ""Dumb & Dumber to"" I would have been just as disappointed. However it was a free film and so like the title says. I will take it. I will watch it, I will enjoy it & I am sure I will watch it again. Because sometimes it is just plain good to see a character or characters come to life again on your screen. Whatever screen that may be.",3
81,1,A Rather Solid Musical!,"The users on this board seemed to concur that this was somehow a bad musical but I disagree. I'm really particular when it comes to people just bursting out into song for no apparent reason and this was one of those few times where I actually liked it. I've always enjoyed the Don Quixote story and this was a fantastic turnaround. I can see why some viewers say that the singing wasn't nearly as extraordinary as it was on Broadway but few film adaptations are. Besides the acting was stellar and it drew out extreme emotions of happiness, sorrow, or laughter out of me at times. Though dirty and ragged I found Sophia Lauren to still be beautiful and her body is absolutely perfect in every way I can fathom. Peter O'Toole was great as a crazy old man set forth on an unattainable quest for glory and at the end someone who had to once again face the harsh life of reality. For those of us who haven't seen it on the stage I feel it is a wonderful performance that was thoroughly enjoyable for persons of all ages that are looking to be whisked away by a tiny bit of magic! I'm positive that I'll have some of the songs stuck in my head for at least several days now.Final Blaze:Movies: I don't usually see musicals on the big screen.DVD Purchase: If my budget ever increases to a more desirable level.Rental: An awesome choice!",8
81,3,A great movie,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time. It saddens me that there are those out there who think this movie was horrible. How can you watch O'Toole give his speech: ""Maddest of all: to see life as it is and not as it should be!"" and not be brought to emotion? This movie is not exactly like the theater version. However, if you note who made the screenplay changes, the song changes, etc., it's the same men who worked on the play. There are some good songs cut out. And Peter O'Toole and Sophia Loren are not the world's best singers. But this movie is brilliant. Coco is a wonderful Sancho, I love his voice and his expression. O'Toole is a fabulous actor and I felt like the prisoners in the end singing ""The Impossible Dream."" I own this movie. I encourage anyone who hasn't seen it to go get it and watch it. It has inspired me to try to do better in everything I do, and I often watch it and sing the songs to remind me to ""see life as it should be."" And if this movie needs a defender, I sign up for the job.",10
81,4,blinded by tears,"I must have a major blind spot because I loved this movie in 1972when I saw it the first time and the second and the third time. NowI have become an semi-regularly woeful countenanced manmyself and I love it even more. My heart started to stir watchingO'Toole's speech at the Oscars so I re-rented La Mancha even asit was being removed from the active shelf at my local Hollywoodvideo. I took it home and played it for the youngest of my fivedaughters, eleven year old Mary. She loves musicals as much as Ido. She got into it. I cried again. Sorry. I love this film. Like I said, Imust have a tin ear or a blind spot or goddamn it, maybe I'm right. Man of La Mancha is a 10 plus and a must for all O'Toole fanswhich at this point should be about everybody who loves movies. Let the revisionism begin here. O'Toole and Loren> C'mon",10
81,9,Greatest Movie Ever,"I consider myself somewhat of a movie aficionado, having seen several thousand movies over the past forty years; and I can unequivocably say that ""Man of La Mancha"" is my all-time favorite movie. While some of the familiar criticisms lodged against it are valid, there is still no other movie that can approach its depth or poignancy. I judge a movie by its ability to move me:  to make me laugh, to make me cry, to make me think. This movie tackles one of the greatest themes of life: whether to live in a helpful illusion or live in the harshness of  reality. Don Quixote's story is the ultimate in human heroism, a tragic man of courage struggling to see and live life, not as it is, but as it should be. His unwavering idealism in the face of all-too-familiar cynicism and skepticism is both foolhardy and inspiring. This movie always leaves me, not with tears trickling, but with great sobbing. I strongly recommend it for both your heart and your head.",10
85,9,Holmes First Case,"Sherlock Holmes Baffled (1900) *** (out of 4) This thirty-second film from American Mutoscope and the Biograph Company is the earliest surviving (and perhaps first made) Sherlock Holmes movie. The story is pretty simple as Holmes walks in on a thief and as he goes to grab him he disappears into thin air. Holmes, as the title suggests, is baffled but the thief reappears only to quickly disappear again. At just 30-seconds one shouldn't go into this thing expecting any type of real story and as you can tell by the story what we're basically got is a Georges Melies rip-off but I must admit that I found it entertaining. The actors are unknown I believe but I enjoyed the Holmes here. There's not much of a performance but I thought the actor did a nice job with his short time and the cigar was a nice touch and something that wouldn't be seen in future versions. The magician tricks aren't nearly as good as what you'd see in an actual Melies movie but at the same time they're actually quite a bit better than most rips including some from this very studio. The disappearance trick happens about three times and it's clearly done with the editing but the effect works well enough. While I'm sure many viewers of today would just see this as some sort of generic junk, it's actually pretty interesting in its own right and not to mention the fact that it's probably the first Holmes movie. That there is reason enough to check it out.",2
85,2,A curiosity,"This strange film was produced by American Mutoscope circa 1900, but it was not released 'till 1903. It's only a few seconds film about a burglar who is surprised during his task by a very strange Sherlock Holmes. It is silly and very schematic, but funny and interesting anyway for Sherlock Holmes Films aficionados...",6
85,5,Important little trick film! hi,"It's impossible to rate this short curio from early film. At the time, film was just a little novelty item to show people something fun to watch for literal seconds in hand crank machines called Nickelodeons (which actually cost pennies most times until they were later projected on crude screens.) But Sherlock Holmes name was extremely well known at the time, and would guarantee several curious viewers. A simple film trick begun by George Melies in France where things seem to vanish by simply removing them from the camera's eye and resuming shooting. The ""actor"" playing the world's greatest detective looks the part but, as the title suggests is baffled by the disappearing-re-appearing burglar who loots the single room. Stationary cameras were common in those days before film found its more inventive directors and cinematographers, so again, there is really no way to rate these type films. They did what they were supposed to do - entertain in a few seconds - so, by those standards, the film does its job. I'm glad to finally own it as an addition to my own Sherlock Holmes collection.",8
85,6,Simplistic yet perplexing noteworthy early Holmes short,"Considering his currently being recognized as one of the most singularly celebrated and iconic fictional characters of literature and cinema, one could be excused for finding Sherlock Holmes Baffled to be somewhat of an underwhelming cinematic debut for the unconventional detective. A thirty second short involving Holmes struggling to capture a teleporting burglar hardly appears to capture the intrigue, suspense and logical foundation of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's novels. In the end, the story itself hardly bears any similarities to the established Sherlock Holmes figure whatsoever, leading one to ruminate on whether it was even intended to be an adaptation of the character when first filmed (the 'Holmes' figure hardly fulfils any of the character's visual iconography). As such, the film remains predominantly a curiosity through its (essentially unnecessary) use of an established fictional character, demonstrating an early and unexpectedly poignant example of movie marketing and use of ancillary markets and art forms to attract viewers - consider how likely the film would be to be recognized were it not billed as 'the first on-screen appearance of Sherlock Holmes'. Nonetheless, to dismiss the film as a single piece of crude marketing or a one-note bit of early cinematic trickery would still be doing it a disservice. As thirty second investments of time go, there are by far enough developments transpiring in the short to merit its recognition, from the bizarre and vaguely comic performance of 'Holmes' to the inexplicable, seemingly supernatural process of the vanishing burglar, lending itself to a slew of metaphoric speculation. It is also worth noting that, lack of narrative arc or not, the film demonstrates an early example of the protagonist losing, as Holmes is unable to capture the burglar, remaining perpetually baffled, as the title would have it. As such, while complexity or narrative sophistication are hardly in store (not that extensive quantities of either within a thirty second short would be a realistic expectation), putting one's self in the position of early 1900s audiences watching the short, gasping at the seeming magic and desperate struggles of the protagonist allows for a wonderfully nostalgic throwback to the days when a (now) simple vanishing act would be sufficient to bewilder, amaze and thoroughly entertain audiences - in essence, all of the aims of contemporary cinema distilled to their most bare bones fundamentals. -8/10",2
92,4,Great documentary,"The movie really normalizes the experience of raising a child with special needs (and believe me, I know) and helps us to see the unique and wonderful qualities of each child, beyond the autism diagnosis. With more children being diagnosed on the autism spectrum each year, this is an important and timely movie which will help those families impacted directly, as well as the broader society. Like mental health issues in ""Girl, Interrupted"" this film shreds light on a subject area that needs more public awareness. And it does so without being overly sentimental. I recommend that families go together to see this documentary.",9
92,5,A venture into the world of autism through the hearts and minds of five children and their parents.,"Powerful, poignant, and beautifully candid, this documentary brings awareness to the viewer in a unique, eye-opening, and often endearing manner. Stemming from their participation in The Miracle Project, a theatre arts program created by Elaine Hall, five autistic children and their parents are followed over a seven-to-eight month period. The viewer is allowed an intimate look into the daily routines of family life, school, therapy, music lessons, and holidays. We are allowed the rare opportunity of entering the world of autism through the eyes of the child and the parents, and gain a seldom-seen or heard perspective from them both that brings about a strong feeling of connectedness. The candor from the parents is both stunning and, at times, raw in its painful truth of autism's impact on the individual parent and in their spousal relationships. Through it all, humor and wit help maintain an upbeat feel so that one leaves not with a sense of heaviness, but with greater awareness, understanding, and hope of what can be. Not to be missed !",10
92,8,Highly Recommend,"Film is an endearing, yet very real glimpse into the daily difficulties of having, and coping with autism. Enjoyed watching the process of the children coming together to create something beyond themselves, and learning to relate to one another in the process. Was refreshing to see them being challenged to do the very opposite of what they are naturally inclined to do and be as autistic children. Or rather what we expect of them. Surprisingly, watching the parents was the most difficult for me. There are moments in the film when it seems the parents have swapped roles and have become more like children themselves. Which gives you the uneasy feeling you get the day you realize your parents are human. Overall film leaves you with a sense of hope. And to hearts that are open, more compassion and understanding. Highly recommend to anyone with an interest in the human condition.",10
92,1,Excellent Movie. So well made.,"This was an excellent movie, an excellent documentary and one of the best I have seen in a long time. The director did a great job really keying to the strong points of each subject(character) particularly Wyatt. He is by far the most intriguing of all the subjects and the director's portrayal of him was absolutely perfect. There are some incredibly strong and emotional moments in this movie that will have you on the brink of tears or crying. The directors decision to just let Wyatt talk and be himself was absolutely the best directorial decision I have ever seen in any movie. His conversation with his mother is absolutely mesmerizing, he is so smart, he is so far beyond his years. It also really sets up the frustration that his parents have because he is smart enough to handle regular classes, yet he still doesn't fit. If he was my son, screw it you go to regular school and you show everybody. The most powerful moment in this film is when Lexi is typing to her mother, and she asks her to explain what Autism is and she can't get out the right words so she just says I love you. I almost cry just thinking about it, and as an actor I will always turn to that scene when I need to shell out emotions, Im surprised her mom didn't respond with more emotion but it is probably because Lexi does that quite often. The frustration of not being able to communicate with your children has got to be the most difficult thing about Autism.I only have a few issues with the film but none to not recommend it. One of my biggest issues is that all of the children in the program are rich from what I saw from the movie. So I think the next group of kids for the miracle project should probably come from slightly different backgrounds. I'm interested to see how people who don't have money deal, because to be frank there are probably tons of kids who have autism that aren't diagnosed as such. They go to school everyday and struggle and struggle and they deal with teachers who don't care and who aren't sympathetic to their needs. So they dismiss them as bad, or crazy or whatever, or add, adhd. I mean seriously how easy would it be to take someone like Adam and label him as just a bad misbehaved kid. It would be terribly easy, and that's what happens to a lot of children. My other issue is that I would have liked to hear a little bit more about the exact diagnosis of the different children's autism, and what autism really is. I do understand that autism is a widely misunderstood disease so maybe that's why.THIS MOVIE IS EXCELLENT, I watch it every time it comes on. And to be honest it changed the way I viewed some things because I myself have had some problems communicating and it really showed me the frustration my family might have from me doing that.",10
93,1,A great stylist falters,"The late Nikos Nikolaidis, who I'm sure like Ken Russell will someday be belatedly elevated by film historians to the pantheon of greatest cinematic stylists, falters in his penultimate film LOSER TAKES ALL, arresting in early reels visually but ultimately falling apart due to gross sentimentality and over-reliance on clichÃ© & in-joking. For budding filmmakers it serves as an object lesson that nihilism and sentimentality don't mix.One IMDb-er invoked Jim Jarmusch as a reference point, which I find off-point but useful nonetheless. That is because Nikolaidis fell victim, like Jarmusch and so many other promising directors (Greenaway, the Kaurismakis, Abel Ferrara; name your own poison) to what I term Filmfestival-it is. As a journalist in the '80s I covered film fests and studied their history, back to pioneering Venice and the tourist-attraction known as Cannes (created to attract folks in the off-season to the fabulous Riviera town).What was once an important phenomenon, say in the '50s and '60s, for discovering talent, creating early-warning-buzz, crystallizing critical opinion and serving as international markets for the buying & selling of film distribution rights, these festivals have proliferated in recent decades to the point of absurdity. Here in NYC, the De Niro-inspired TriBeCa Film Festival, a response to 9/11, has a nearly unrivaled track record of screening thousands of awful movies making it useful, as critics like Rex Reed were laughingly referred to back when, as an inverse barometer of a film's worth -if it was shown at TriBeCa it should be avoided.For Nikolaidis and an increasing number of filmmakers, festival coverage no longer promotes or introduces a film but rather eats up its potential audience - the filmmaker trading eyeballs for truly paying customers at commercial cinemas. Sure, there are ancillary benefits with video deals, pay-cable and now streaming or VOD exposure, but festival screenings turn out to be the elephants' graveyard for many titles, benefiting the fest's local economy (and backers/staff) but more of a loss leader for a big local party than honest film exhibition as we once knew it before the industry's tail started wagging the dog in the Video Era.Worse yet is the pernicious effect of pandering to the gatekeepers of the festival circuit, many of whose ancestors I knew back in the '80s -the head honchos at Berlin, Sundance, Edinburgh, etc. A certain type of film catches on with these elites and their sycophants in what remains of the ""film critic"" world (now a job position as obsolete as ""travel agent""). What they like is what they get, accounting for the clichÃ©d nature of so many national cinemas that supply fodder for fests. For example I recall the quirky British stereotypical comedies made in the wake of GREGORY'S GIRL's success over 3 decades back, and still with us today, or the dull results of the ""indie"" movement of the '80s.LOSER TAKES ALL falls into this rut, opening with beautiful atmospherics and overt (but in color) homage to film noir, right down to a Raoul Walsh WHITE HEAT poster prominently displayed. But unfortunately we don't have Boetticher, Fuller, Walsh, Siodmak and N. Ray as our heroes any more. Instead Nikos begins with tedious Abel Ferrara clichÃ©s and quickly segues to almost a parody of the Aki Kaurismaki ironic approach to cinema: the no-good heroes & heroines, drinking beer, making dumb witticisms or in this case allegorical references as small-talk, and putting up competing cynical world-views while deep-down harboring the most sentimental notions of heroism and camaraderie. Our hero, rock-musician in real life turned lead actor (and not a good one at that) is certainly out of the Kaurismaki Bros. game book, and his rottenness (stealing the ring off the finger of the dead mother of another lead character) to comically pawn or idle rape is just a grinning hipness hiding the film's maudlin central heartbeat.Certain elements remain relevant: the hero's Luddite philosophy is almost poignant (he rejects a cell phone for example) now that the war against rampaging technology has been lost; his insistence on drachmas instead of those horrible Euros is the source of unintended black humor given Greece's on-going fiscal crisis; and the persistent ""We gotta get out of this place"" theme is still a powerful if overdone message for those of us who came of age in the '60s.The movie's many crucial faults include a cavalier attitude towards characters, most notably the comic relief drunken beauty who keeps throwing up on the main actress referred to as Black Beauty (Louise Attah, often speaking in English), and the irritating and predictable use of the Leonard Cohen figure (singing his own mournful ballads in English throughout) guitarist whose sentimental end was bad fimmaking at its worst. Similarly, the stunning shots in the first reel are followed by tiresome, poorly staged confrontations in the rest of the film that even crappy action movie directors execute far better than Nikos. Our impervious hero shooting off his gun randomly at baddies is ridiculous on all levels and killed off my involvement in the ongoing story.",10
93,5,O hamenos ta pernei ola,"A great movie if we consider that is created by Greek director and actors; it is also filmed in Greece which is not the best country for filming a movie and i guess without the proper (Hollywood) equipment and staff, such as painters, stylists etc.The star of the movie is Yiannis Aggelakas, who is the leader of the Greek rock band 'Trypes', which is very famous to all Greek and Cypriot people. His acting absolutely matches his role, so as a fan of him i have to give him a big thumb up! The movie is related to drugs and prostitution, and in more general, the underworld of Greece. The movie in the beginning is simple and slow, but in the end it gets more and more exciting unleashing the atmosphere of the underworld making the movie really interesting.If you are a speaker of the Greek language is worth the time to watch it. It's one of the best Greek movies ever!",2
93,6,its a beautiful world,"Probably one of the greatest underworld movies ever created in a non-Hollywood environment. Man (gianis aggelakas), a mysterious man of the underworld, small time grifter and big time hard-man,who has an anarchic tendency to mumble and comment on the system, society, police, the underworld itself and other things,along with his beloved bird, Bellafonte, meets up with an odd posse consisting of kid, who is a young songwriter, a prostitute who gathers money in order to open o bookstore, an alcoholic girl haunted by the relationship with her dead mother, and the grudgey bar-woman-ex-girlfriend. The five of them get caught up in a scheme involving the media, the mob, politicians and the police. And they definitely want to get the hell out of the city, probably to some Caribbean paradise.This is the third Nicolaides film that has to do with Greek gangland, and the end of his ""crime trilogy"". Again,like in Glykeia Symmoria, nicolaides makes his own social comments, either using Man as a mouthpiece (mind you the lyrics of Trypes, the band where aggelakas used to sing in are very ""socially aware""), or throughout the plot. The violence is still tough, but there is a wee progressive notion in the film, a sense that nicolaides has matured, and is trying to move on to newer things since Glykeia Symmoria, making a film that has the speed of a Jarmusch movie, with an underground storyline.Trivia one: The most of the outside scenes were filmed in the district of Exarchia (Athens), which was famous in the eighties and the nineties as a place where anarchists, drug addicts, petty criminals and rockers hang outTrivia two: The house were the rave scene was filmed, was torn down a few weeks after the shootTrivia three: The bar were the barmaid is working, was built in 1830. At first it was housing one of King Otthos commissars.During the 20th century it was neglected, or used as a brothel.Since the mid 1980s it houses club decadence, one of the most famous alternative rock bars in Athens",7
119,1,"The ""Unthinkable Act"" was the making of this ""movie.""","Utterly horrendous. The opening scene features strong flickering from the fluorescent lights because the genius production crew didn't know how to set the flicker filter filter on their $300 camera - and it just gets worse from there.It feels like they took a script for a 15-minute short and did their best to stretch it to ""feature-length,"" but their best wasn't anywhere near enough.Plenty of zombie-like acting (no, they're not supposed to be zombies) on par with what you'd expect from a high school drama class (and that's being very generous). Shocking editing (some scenes cut in before the actors have even finished preparing for it), shocking audio (hard-surface resonance, no equalisation whatsoever), and video framing you'd expect from a wedding photographer.Steer clear of this one.",1

130,2,Most underrated film yet,"I'm truly grateful my instincts served me. The trailers were not great and the IMDb ratings for this film were awful... but I watched it anyway. IT WAS GREAT. No criticisms at all. I guess if you think 'hollywood nonsense' all flash no story makes a great movie, then this isn't for you. If you liked movies like District 9, then this will be right up your alley. Great characters, great story, great cinematography, great effects and great action!I hardly EVER write reviews but just HAD to to try to make up for the poor reviews by idiots who have no idea...",8
130,8,Better than the reviews would indicate,"The title Outpost 37 is much better than the alternative Alien Outpost, the latter seeming to suggest some crappy Uwe Boll type film.In fact I was very pleasantly surprised by the premise, the acting, and the cinematography. Although very aware that this was a low budget film with a necessary limit on special effects, I was engrossed by the story all the way to an end - which, albeit a little obvious some way before, was a satisfactory one. It left some questions and highlighted a couple of plot holes, but it was still way better than its budget would suggest.What effects there were were effective, the cinematography and the editing sharp and snappy, and the actors surprisingly above par and very comfortable in their roles, making the film believable all the way through.All in all a good couple of hours well spent.",7
130,1,Decent Movie Interesting Premise,"This was an OK movie to me and I was surprised that it got such low overall score. The premise was unique and grounded (relatively speaking) in the reality of what might occur if a failed alien attack took place. The acting was OK. There were a few two dimensional characters, but I felt the relationship between the soldiers was on point as well as some of the male bonding hazing. When one of the soldiers died you really felt the emotion of the team. The special effects for the budget were pretty good and the ending was solid as was the build up. I would definitely watch a sequel to the movie.",7
130,7,It's a good waste of time,"This movie deserves so much more attention and praise than it have gotten. You need to give this movie a chance, the acting is good. The story although slow to begin with is very engaging and well written. I have heard people say that the special effects are cheep, but honestly i have no idea where they get it from, first of all there aren't that many and the ones that are there looks perfectly fine.Regarding the story, its feels like what a sequel to ""Battle Los Angeles""could have been. So if you liked that movie, i guarantee you will like this one, even if you like ""war/conflict"" movies you will like it, if you like sci-fi you will like it.I personally really enjoy these movies that come in from the side lines, having not been over hyped or expected for 6 months, and then out of no where it will provide you with an hour and 45 minutes of very well made entertainment.",8
143,5,loved it!,"this movie got me to register here, and go through all the rigamaroll to tell you what i thought of it. Super Hero Party Clown is a little gem of a movie, letting comic book fans young and old of the importance that they play in our lives, on a low budjet, as comic books are, and as this this movie is. But that is the strength of it, and the directors pulled it off, with flying colors in my humble opinion. Anyone who has had a super hero, past or present, like underdog for example, will understand that the people making this movie understand very well and have the talent and perseverance to go through whatever it took to make this movie and hung in there, just like a superhero, they are too. Corny, but so are all those who say, ""Grow up"", and would send this gem to the scrapheap!",8
170,1,Something lost in translation,"Sunhi returns to the film school she graduated from a year before and starts to run into old friends. She's interested in some, others are interested in her. Awkward encounters ensue, heavy drinking and eating chicken. It's a sort of a Rom-Com, but with some kind of Korean twist that I didn't completely understand. The closest comparison is an extended episode of Seinfeld, or perhaps a Woody Allen movie.I saw this film yesterday at Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF). On the plus side, there were a number of funny scenes, especially revolving around the game of telephone being played between the four main characters as they talk about Sunhi, each other, how they need to dig deeper to find themselves, etc. On the downside, not much happens, I never really got into any of the characters, and ultimately I was a bit bored.I suspect that there's a cultural and language disconnect. I don't think that the subtitles did justice to what seemed to be some clever repetition of lines and memes circling between the characters. Culturally, I know that Korea has a deep and quite dissimilar culture compared to Canada. So, I suspect that many of the jokes and potentially the romanticism was lost on me. Director Hong Sang-soo is said to be quite successful in Korea. Perhaps with a better introduction by the festival staff, and improved subtitles, this film could be more successful. As it is I can only give it a 6/10.",6
170,6,Slow-paced drama/romance about... nothing,"It feels like an idea was to make a movie that somewhat resembles ""Lost in Translation"". Well... It didn't pan out. It is extremally slow, almost no sounds except for dialogues which aren't particularly entertaining or witty, no real action or plot development of any kind - the movie literally consists of a few scenes where our characters meet up and talk. It has a pretty positive vibe, perhaps somebody can find it climatic but all in all it is pretty boring and disappointingly uneventful. After I have watched it, I literally have no clue what this piece was supposed to be about. It does remind me of ""Lost of Translation"" a lot but it didn't even got close to S. Coppola's movie on a shelf. Not bad overall but I find it hard to go above 5/10.",5
181,6,"Talky, draggy crime drama","Stop me if you've heard this one before: a drug syndicate is killing people in Paris. A young and (supposedly) top-class police officer is assigned to bring them down. That's it for plot. The hero is a pretty nondescript and inexpressive figure, so at some point the film switches to a crooked lawyer who's working for the syndicate, and who is pushed to his limits by both sides; in this role, Robert Hossein is literally the only somewhat interesting character in the film, which also lacks memorable action scenes or locations. Just about the ONLY inspired touch comes at the opening credits, which appear and get ""deleted"" by a car's windshield wipers; after that point, this film is like a hundred others, most of them much better. * out of 4.",3
191,3,one of the most classic 'LA' scenes ever,"As someone that spent 18 years in the city of Angels, I have met many Ellie Parkers. I adored this little gem, albeit low budget movie, with some of best acting one could feast their eyes on. The scene with Ellie in the car in a complete hyped up, Star Bucks frenzy, smeared with lipstick, banging her head to Blondie and madly shouting out "" I wanna suck Vinnie's ####'!!!"" in her New Jersey accent, had me rolling on the floor.For those that know nothing of the dashed dreams of Many desperate Hollywood starlets, and the pure sleaze these women encounter as they try to fulfill their dreams, forget it, you just won't 'get it'. LA is a town, of big talking wannabes and 'Ellie Parker' really led you into that world with it's fake facade and empty promises. Naomi Watts just shines as Ellie Parker. She totally engulfs the screen with her magical expressions of pain, joy, angst, fear, confusion and loneliness.I felt very empty after the final scene, just as Ellie did. The City of Angels changes you, makes you selfish, egotistical, and almost insane. Ellie knew her pursuit of acting had caused her to become a shell of a person, and as a viewer I really felt her pain.So it was shot with a cheap camera, big deal. The messages where there, contrary to what many other reviewers said, you just had to be sensitive enough to pick them up.This film really transported me back to LA, and made me shudder, thanks 'Eliie parker' for reminding me why I left!",8
191,6,Superb Tour De Force for Naomi Watts,"If you are a fan of Naomi Watts, as I have been since seeing her for the first time in Mulholland Drive, you will not want to miss Ellie Parker - a veritable tour de force for the actor, who gives us not a caricature but rather a sympathetic, flesh-and-blood, 3-dimensional human being whose plight pertains not only to the acting world but to anybody who has ever felt rejected, misunderstood and/or unappreciated by the world at large. This makes its audience much wider than merely the 'Hollywood community' without ever becoming preachy about it, which I especially liked. Some of the scenes feel completely improvised, which I also enjoyed, and her audition scene near the beginning is more than worth the price of admission alone.",7
191,7,I loved this movie....,"I saw this at Sundance and I certainly didn't see anyone walking out during that screening. Sundance movie goers are notoriously supportive of films at the festival and I have a hard time believing there were people walking out.I thought Scott Coffee wrote a very original and true to life story of Hollywood. There have been many movies about Hollywood life but this one is real and true to the bone. Every actor who sees this will see themselves in this and say ""Why didn't I write this?"". The answer is, Scott thought of it and we didn't. Way to go Scott.Naomi Watts is wonderful as always. Many layers to this. Maybe people outside Hollywood wont get this movie. Their loss.",10
191,8,Fun if you like this sort of thing,"""Ellie Parker"" is the sort of movie that you wish you could have made in college. It's funny, somewhat different, and has a beautiful leading lady, that of which goes by the name of Naomi Watts in this case. It also has an incredibly low budget. As a matter of fact, it looks as though it could have been a college student's project. An hour and a half showcasing Naomi Watt's fantastic amount of talent as Ellie Parker: A struggling actress jumping from audition to audition with the hope of landing a part in anything she can get. Her loser boyfriend is no help, neither is her agent, and as the days go by, she loses more and more hope. Whether she's cruising down Sunset Strip to her next audition, or yelling into her cellular flying down the 101, there is a part of us throughout the entire movie that wants to know what is going to happen to Ellie next. She's lovable. She's talented. She's been through more than we (the audience) can begin to understand. But most importantly, she's determined.If you adore Watts as much as this reviewer does and you want to see her in something realistic (as close as it gets), check out ""Ellie Parker"". You won't get to see her like this in ""King Kong."" That's for sure.",8
226,8,"Not really what I expected, but if you're a fan of Wilson it's mildly amusing","I'm a big fan of Owen Wilson when he's in the right genre. He has proved to be a considerably good talent in drama as well, but comedy is his real niche. The whole ""Frat Pack"" sub-genre that is popular right now is where he most belongs, and as such ""You, Me and Dupree"" offers what one would expect from a comedy starring Owen Wilson as a slacker who leeches off of people.What I didn't expect from this comedy was its dark side. Matt Dillon's character turns pretty nasty and his relationship with wife Kate Hudson gets rough. Likewise his confrontational scenes with Michael Douglas seem to betray the lighter attitude of the scenes involving Dupree (Wilson). The movie has a few twists and turns that I didn't expect - when I saw the ads I figured it would be an OK-but-forgettable movie about a guy crashing in a newly-married couple's house, end of story: but there's actually more to the story here. It doesn't necessarily make it stand out (it's not a very good film) - but the movie moves away from Dupree being a pest and actually begins to focus on Dillon's growing anger towards his friend as he believes him to be developing a crush on his wife. The whole subplot with Douglas' character (playing the father of Hudson) becomes quite prominent in the film as well. This is where it really takes a turn for the worse.Whereas for the first hour or so is fun and predictable in the vein of Wilson's other films, once it begins trying to develop a ""showdown"" of sorts between all its characters it gets to be too much. The ending sequence involving Wilson being chased by a Samoan security guard is way over-the-top and betrays the realistic roots of the movie.I also didn't care much for Dillon's character. I could relate to his frustration but he almost seemed TOO realistic for this film. You know when critics complain in these movies about how clichÃ©d the ""nice guy"" characters always are? Well Dillson isn't a nice guy in this movie - he's got a hot temper and loses his cool a bunch of times in the movie. Towards the end he's like a mad, violent alcoholic and I started to feel like Dupree should end up with his wife instead.Overall the first hour of this movie is fun and entertaining and has its fair share of humorous segments - I laughed a lot when Dupree burns down a house and at some of the early jokes involving his interaction with old buddies - but the movie obviously realizes this isn't enough of a plot for a 90-minute feature and tries to develop other plot lines 3/4 of the way through, and that's when it gets tiresome. The ending ultimately left a bad taste in my mouth and felt tacky. It seemed like a last-minute ending that was filmed after poor test screenings. A relationship crisis involving Dupree is never even resolved in the movie - as if the crew totally forgot about it.I guess I would have left the theater feeling more fulfilled if perhaps the film had continued as a lightweight ""frat pack""-style comedy rather than trying to rise above other genre entries. I acknowledge the film's attempts at becoming ""more"" than just another comedy of this type - but they chose the wrong path and just made it worse. In this case it's an example of a shallow movie trying too hard to be something else.I liked it, and I was entertained, but it's better left as a rental and only if you're a fan of the actors. (By the way, it's worth mentioning that apart from Wilson's hilarious performance, Kate Hudson really impressed me and had more of a realistic role than women do in most of these sorts of films. You can't slam ""You, Me and Dupree"" for not at least trying.)",6
226,1,"The critics are wrong, dead wrong","Last night a friend coaxed me into seeing ""You, Me and Dupree."" Even though I have liked all four of its principal actors for years, I hadn't planned on seeing it last night or possibly ever. The reviews have been uniformly terrible, so I was expecting the worst. I sat in a movie theater that was perhaps one-third full, and I was waiting for the boredom to set in, which the critics said was comingÂ—in spades.Yes, Owen Wilson has bleached-blond locks, again, but that is probably the only accurate comment in any of the reviews that I saw, and I must have read at least ten of them, from various parts of the country. He was very good, as he was in the ""Wedding Crashers."" Kate Hudson was perky as always, and did a splendid job; and anyone who has loved her mother over the years will find Goldie's ""clone"" just as lovely as ever.Matt Dillon did a terrific job, and was totally believable comically; and Michael Douglas was very good too, playing his character with aplomb. In short, it was a very funny movie, and quite refreshing given the alternatives; namely, movies that are loaded to the gills with special effects, which jar one's cranium to the uttermost.It seems like the critics were in lock step in panning this film, which may be driving away audiences unfairly. Indeed, this may be a perfect example of the critics being wrong, dead wrong. Go see it in a theater, or buy a DVD when it comes out, and my guess is that you will not be disappointed one iotaÂ—and may actually love it. All four principal actors are perfectly balanced, and they are strong enough to be wonderful foils to one another.",7
226,6,"Not great, but it's good for a few chuckles and a two-hour break from reality","Whenever a movie mistakenly thinks a bad pun of a tagline (""Dupree's a crowd"" anyone?) is gonna rope in ye olde movie-going audience, there is officially room to be concerned with what you're about to watch. OK, so the tagline isn't as bad as some, but it is enough to raise a red flag. However, is it enough to indicate what's to come? Welp, I'm happy to say that once again I'm gonna keep my distance from all your unfavorite (I'm makin' up words, baby!) stuffed-shirt critics out there who are giving You, Me and Dupree a merciless shredding because it doesn't meet the inherent level of pretension they so girlfriendlessly demand. That's right, folks. I, Johnny Betts, enjoyed You, Me and Dupree. I'm one of about three movie reviewers to boldly make that claim, but doggone on it, I'm sticking by it.Granted, my enjoyment was heightened due to the fact that I kept my expectations low and didn't have to pay to see the movie, but I was entertained all the same.It's only fair that I be perfectly honest and admit I'm somewhat easily amused when it comes to watching actors and actresses that I really like, and Dupree sports a great cast. Mileages will vary depending on your tolerance level of the actors involved.Owen Wilson is one of my constant comedic favorites, once again displaying that crooked nose we all love and projecting child-like innocence with his signature charm. I also love his ability to sincerely deliver outrageous and cheesy lines in ways that make them seem not quite so outrageous or silly.Then there's Kate Hudson, only the absolute cutest thing that Hollywood has going for it. She plays this role a little more low key than usual, but she's still irresistible, evidenced by her black bikini scene where she proves that she inherited what was always her mom's best *ahem* asset.Rounding out the cast, straight-man Matt Dillon's cool as always, and Seth Rogen, though woefully underused, brings an impressive laughs-to-screen time ratio. Most of you will remember him from The 40 Year-Old Virgin, but he'll always be Ken Miller and Ron Garner to me. If neither of those names means anything to you then we need to have a serious talk about a couple of DVD sets you might want to consider acquiring.Is this a film that'll find its way to the top of any of these actors' resumes? No. Is it a non-stop laugh-fest? No. Is it a film I can watch over and over and cry with laughter every time? Nah. Will you be disappointed if you're expecting something along the lines of The Wedding Crashers? Most likely.After all, I never said the movie doesn't have its flaws. Some of the humor is a little too conventional and predictable, and the dramatic dialogue isn't exactly the most compelling to grace the screen, so no, this isn't gonna go down in the Book of Comedy Classics, nor do I feel a necessity to pencil it in as a future addition to my DVD collection (unless the special features are loaded with Kateness). But I found it to be a fun, light-hearted, silly way to take a 2-hour break from the real world. As I mentioned in the paragraphs above, its greatest strength is in its likable cast and their chemistry, and I appreciate the charm it displayed in never taking itself too seriously.Plus, the majority of the screening crowd seemed to enjoy it. I've personally never had nor been a third wheel like Dupree, but those of you who can relate to such an experience might appreciate it on a different level.I can't say that You, Me and Dupree is a film that just absolutely demands to be seen on the big screen, but it's certainly the kind of movie that you usually watch with friends and family where most everyone will walk away with a good chuckle, no one will be overly offended, Aunt Ella will comment on how ""it was cute,"" no one's life will be dramatically altered, and Uncle Larry's uninvited segue into some boring recollections about his own ""Dupree"" experiences will wake everybody back up to their nightmare reality.All in all, if you think no one can bring seven different kinds of smoke like Owen Wilson, and you find Kate Hudson to be seven different kinds of smokin' then there's something here for you to enjoy. Be it at a matinÃ©e or as a future rental. It might just help you discover your ""ness."" THE GIST You, Me and Dupree might not deliver two solid hours of nothing but out-loud laughter and the dramatic elements might falter at times, but there's no denying that the cast is great, and if you love those involved then you'll find some enjoyment here. I wouldn't pay more than matinÃ©e prices, and if you don't have a lot of spending money to throw around then just save it for a rental.",6
226,3,A little messy but very enjoyable,"Crazy home wrecker comedy mostly unfortunate and heartwarming. By the great Russo Brothers that did several Avenger movies so this still has awesome vibe to it despite the flaws! The cast is pretty great throughout, I like how wild things are in some parts. I think You, Me and Dupree is great for what it is!",7
255,5,Saw them make the film: Not fun. Watched the film: Not good.,"This film was made nearby where I lived in 1986.  Many residents had to put up with trailers on the street and generators running into all hours of the evening.  We did however, get to see Cosby shoot a scene, so that was fun.When it came time to see his creation, the disappointment was even greater having expected at least something of fair value. The film is disjointed, as if the writer quit in the middle. The relationship between Cosby - a master spy living in an enormous house - and his unhappy wife (who lives in the enormous house next door, which is supposed to be a funny circumstance) took time to develop. Then it was immediately lost in some mad-cap chase scenes in a warehouse.There is nothing interesting about this film. There must be a story behind how it got made. Cosby is a man of talent, but this film showed none.",1
255,7,Merciful God in heaven above!!!!!!!,"Bill Cosby must have lost some kind of bet with Satan to end up making a film as mind-meltingly dreadful as ""Leonard Part 6"". A stupefyingly unfunny, self-indulgent mess of a film that will have you wanting to tare your skin off with your fingernails just so you'll have something else to do.",1
255,2,Betrayal & Redemption,"I saw this pus-filled boil on Cosby's rump while on vacation in Florida as a kid. I asked to see it - How was I to know? - I was only 6 years old. I think it was being shown at a theater at Universal Studios, and it had been a long, hot day of walking. Hell, I was glad just to be off my feet and out of the sun...that is, until the movie began.I was confused from the start, thinking I must have missed a lot in the first 5 parts. But I thought it's gotta get better, Bill Cosby  wouldn't allow this garbage to be shown to millions of kids like me as ""entertainment"" unless there was something funny in it. Then the meat patties - I don't remember much about the movie, I've left the nightmares in my past, but I can still remember how I nearly wretched at this grisly mess of a scene. It was no longer worth being in a comfy theater with AC, it was more like being in agony, trapped by a 6-yr. old kid's optimism that ""Mr. Huxable"" would be funny! Never happened. An utter horror of a movie! It ruined a little kid's day, and I'm sure it ruined many others'. When I found out from my folks soon after that Bill Cosby himself had told people not to see it, I was hurt and betrayed. I have since gotten over it, so LP6 is purged from my nightmares, and I applauded Cos for removing this celluloid pollution from our airwaves. Redemption at last.",1
255,8,Made me never want to eat Jello again.,"Three words sum up what's wrong with this movie, Joe Don Baker. Serously, what the hell was that? It's like a bad version of Dr Dolittle made by acid heads. I actually saw this movie in the theater as a child and even at the tender age of 6 asked my Mom if we could leave and began crying when we didn't. This movie sucks!",1
282,5,Recommended for the stunts,"The Casting details for this film are a little sparse and think that Rudakova's acting as Natalya is well worth a mention there, really good. Berleand as Francois was OK at his acting too, Statham is maybe not that popular in his role; as always playing a very straight part as Janson. (+ and - follows)(+) This comes well recommended for it's action; having that perfect high tension/tempo shown in the earlier films. The fight scenes are still very well done, as are the driving stunts.(-) There is not a high level of acting needed here, yet that brings you down to that real life feel I guess. Transporter 1-2 are still the better films with more varied action and better plot.",8
290,5,It took time to get it,"Have you ever watched Persona by Ingmar Bergman?
I did.
Apparently Cam Archer watched it too.",10
290,4,Years of Retirement,"This film might be too experimental and fragmented for its own good, but it is enlivened by fantastic performance by Ellen Barkin as Colleen West, an retired actress trying to find her place in the world she is not familiar with. The film doesn't follow traditional narrative and scenes jump from present to past, and between dreaming, dreams and nightmares (there is one haunting scene near the end the puts most contemporary horror films into shame). Yet, this fragmented flow of the film doesn't take anything away from Ellen Barkin's wonderful character. Actually it all enhances her confusion - did she already loose everything (herself among) while she was working as an actress or, everything went loss after her retirement? It is my own personal interpretation, that she was already lost, but when she quit the circus she just started to see the things. Although, experimental with its directing style and it sounds pretentious self search/loss story, the film stands much higher than your usual artsy film school stuff that deals with existencial crisis. The heightened meaning behind this might come from Barkin's performance and her own life experience. Don't be afraid that film, although black and white, might be too depressive or bleak, as it offers some nice laughs. Especially scenes between Colleen West and her new neighbor Shelly (Melora Walters). Barkin's character is wonderfully arrogant and self conscious, but not unpleasant, actually she is very cool.Definitely not for everyone, but this movie has definitely hasn't got the recognition it truly deserves.",7
290,2,"i don't usually write stuff online, but...","...i feel like i have to set something against what has been written about this film in an earlier review on this website. sht year is a very sensitive, empathetic portrait about an eccentric, depressive yet somehow sympathetic woman, it is a film about loss, the loss of meaning, sense, purpose, occupation, loss of love and ultimately about the fear of the end of loss of having nothing more to lose. since the other review is highly subjective and since i don't know how to write a decent review i will just say: there are a lot of things i like about this film, i just watched it again after about 3 years and, again, i greatly enjoyed it. but even if you're not into the kind of photography/videoart aesthetics archer employs along with his talent for stillness, even if you don't recognize the existential struggle with identity and being a real person in a real life world that gifted actors seem to be prone to and which is embodied here by such an actress in a very very courageous, intimate and personal way, even if you do not identify with the character or the imagery, one must acknowledge that it is a strong and unusual film. it is by no means trashy or cheap or attempting to be something it is not, like the other review suggests. im not saying you're wrong in not enjoying it since its your subjective experience, but you're making it sound like its impossible that anyone might enjoy it and its total crap which is not true at all. it is a strong movie, it has a strong point, and a sense of urgency. it is artistic expression by means of film on a high level in the way its written, performed, captured and produced. so im not saying its for anyone, everyone should watch it, but i like it a lot and its certainly worth a shot. it deserves to be taken seriously, please don't just dismiss it because one dude on IMDb couldn't make sense of it. i could and i recommend it as well as archers first feature length film ""wild tigers I've known"" (again very specific images, but if they tell your story it can feel like someone knows whats in your heart and i am thankful for that, its the best thing about art!)",8
290,1,there is clue in the title,"i had my doubts about writing a review about this movie, it feels like kicking a child with a downÂ syndrome, but if that child constantly bites you then there is no choice, is there? the movie is about a constantly talking actress who is obsessed with herself, trying to come in terms with her retirement. i usually like experimental movies, but this wasn't an experimental movie, it was just a wanna be project, i was okay if it didn't have any meaningful purpose, but this movie tried so hard to be meaningful in an experimental way which is really not a good idea, horrible idea to be clear. the biggest issue in the movie is that it is like a diary, nothing visual on it, the fact that this director also directed music videos is beyond me. it is like we are watching a monologue of a boring woman who constantly repeat herself then director remembers that he is shooting a movie and adds something visual but not so amazing images.to cut the long story short(unlike the movie), i would believe if the director turned out to be a high school student who's favorite movie is 'a single man'. it tells nothing new, it is a real wanna be movie, and it is real a waste of time, i hope i never watch a movie like this again. (actually it is really hard to call this thing a movie.)",1
304,8,Superb Documentary,Any documentary that gets a slam from the history deniers in Japan is A+. The evidence is overwhelming. These were brutal crimes committed by imperial Japanese soldiers. Abe should resign. Period.,10
304,1,Insightful with a small budget,"The maker of this documentary can be really proud of himself. This is a must see for anyone who is new to the comfort women issue. Even with a small budget, this young director has showed all the important facets of the problem. It is very interesting to see how the interviewed people have such conflicting answers.Furthermore, these documentaries are so important for global history to unravel the truth. Besides the comfort women issue the viewer will also learn about Japanese modern history. Brilliant!",10
304,4,An exciting work to stimulate our intelligence.,"This film describes what historical revisionist is and makes us recognize the importance of correct history. Some likely want to see what to want. Revisionists sneak in there. Carefully we should keep eye on it. Anyway, this film is well made to entertain us, showing various opinion through comfort women issue. Good!",10
304,5,Thought Provoking and Insightful,"This is not merely an issue between two nations with a war time past but an exploration of how we are to confront a nation's past, ugly or otherwise.This is a well researched and thoroughly researched documentary explores Japan's right-wing revisionist points of view, their position and their motivations.Ultimately this is Mr.Miki Dezaki's impassioned plea to the country of his ethnic origin to contemplate the road they are currently on and where it leads.",8
306,9,All they want is freedom.,"Just got back from the world premier at TIFF 07 and I am impressed. Like the gun market journey from the ""Vice Guide"" Eddy and Suroosh drew out the important issues behind the primary subject matter. I found the journey of the young men and their evolution through extreme turmoil delivered in a raw manner that one does not get through main stream media. The raw look at life and oppression that continues from the old Saddam regime into the new present day Iraq is shocking. The movie is shown through several time periods in the bands life and how playing music is the only thing that keeps them going. The band members that are interviewed are well spoken, articulate, and emotional. That emotion keeps coming back in the film and every happiness in their lives is tempered by the Iraq war to such a degree that the true impact of what's happening over there is just now becoming clearer. For me the true role and impact of the mass market main-stream media has been exposed and for that reason alone I would suggest watching ""Heavy Metal in Baghdad"". I also look forward to any subsequent sequels or Vice production regarding the lives of the band members but especially Tony and his pupil Mike.Thank you Eddy and Suroosh.",9
306,2,More a film about humanity in war than 'heavy metal',"I found myself surprised to like a film about heavy metal this much. Just personal taste, but it's not music that usually speaks to me.But this tragic, darkly comic, oddly triumphant and endearing look at a group of young Iraqis trying to keep their band together and play - in the middle of the insanity of war, and then later in exile in Syria - and also seeing the crazy bravery of the two young guys trying to make a film about them - has stuck in my head with very fond feelings. By making the war and it's effects this personal I came away with a much deeper understanding than I might have from a film trying to cover the whole wide landscape. I wasn't quite as moved on a second viewing with friends, but it's still a film I think of with tremendous warmth, and recommend whether you like heavy metal or not.",8
306,3,Rock on!!,"This documentary really opened my eyes to the simple pleasures that we take for granted . I was really moved by the fact that I can just hop in my car go to a gig and let my anger out in the pit and just live life . This documentary brings to light the hardships that occur in Iraq , and to this band the only thing that makes them free is getting together to jam and record a album . you will feel a whole new sense of self after seeing this documentary trust me. I as a Canadian feel a great injustice of what is occurring in Iraq after viewing this , but ,media and politics dictate what they want you to see. Wake up north America ! and create a world that we can all just be free to express ourselves in whatever form we choose .",10
306,1,A documentary that must be seen,"I too saw this explosive high-risk film at the Toronto film festival, the day after Abu Risha, head of the Anbar Awakening Council in the supposedly ""pacified"" region of Iraq's notorious ""Sunni triangle"" was blown up ten days after meeting with President George Bush.In their first venture into feature-length guerrilla film-making, Moretti, head of VICE Films, and Alvi, co-founder of counterculture VICE magazine, follow what has happened to the members of ""Acrassicauda"" (Latin for black scorpion), Iraq's first and only heavy metal band. They note that the band had played four concerts during the Saddam era by including a song praising the tyrant which everyone knew was an ironic fake. Since the Coalition ""liberation"" of 2003, they have played only two, the last in the summer of 2005. Since then all have joined the ranks of the over two million Iraqi refugees (another nearly two million are internally displaced), over a million alone in neighboring Syria. The U.S. during this time has accepted less than 500.Shot by the intrepid duo in high-definition video during two dangerous trips to Baghdad and one to Damascus, the film contains candid interviews with band members, all apolitical and non-sectarian, speaking obscenity-laced English street talk. But then, their situation is obscenely perilous and unfree. It is not surprising for one to say: ""(Expletive) this democracy"", when their experience is one of a worsening life in hell followed by a ""less than zero"" subsistence exile in Damascus.After the screening, the filmmakers informed the audience that band members had been refused Canadian visas to come to the festival, that they were facing expulsion back to Iraq from Syria by October 10, and appealed for donations through the website http://www.heavymetalinbaghdad.com/ to help them relocate.",10
309,5,Pleasantly surprised,"The third installment of musical clips from the MGM vaults. I'm a sucker for musicals and ""That's Entertainment! III"" was a huge surprise. I thoroughly liked the first part (""That's Entertainment!""); the second installment (""That's Entertainment, Part II"") was decent but not that memorable, but this third compilation towers over its predecessors. One of the riches of the ""That's Entertainment!III"" is that the filmmakers are very critical and passionate about the subject. As much as they are paying homage to the glory of the MGM dream factory, they are also depicting the skill and the hard work that go along with it. This is perhaps the reason serious film critics seem to rhapsodize about it. Lots of pleasant & glorious moments, featuring many musical numbers, most of them cut from the original releases. Particularly revealing are: Eleanor Powell's tap dancing in ""Lady Be Good"" (in split-screen while the camera moving along with her); Lena Horne speaks about the prejudiced policies at MGM, introducing a nice censored bath scene from ""A Cabin the Sky""; and Debbie Reynolds' rare number ""You're My Lucky Star"", cut from ""Singin' in the Rain"".",8
309,9,Highly Enjoyable MGM Entertainment...socko!!,"It's easy to see why Siskel & Ebert gave this one a big two thumbs up. And even the hard to please Rex Reed said: ""Two hours of paradise regained--pure magic!""Easily among the best of the 'That's Entertainment' compilations, it features June Allyson, Cyd Charisse, Lena Horne, Howard Keel, Ann Miller, Debbie Reynolds, Mickey Rooney and Esther Williams all giving us a guided tour of some of their best MGM moments. The late Gene Kelly is included among the hosts.Especially fascinating is the dance sequence showing how the crew worked hard to keep up with Eleanor Powell's dance routine in ""Lady Be Good""; Esther in an underwater number for 'Jupiter's Darling'; and outtakes of Judy Garland's attempt at 'Annie Get Your Gun'. Elvis fans will get a chance to see his 'Jailhouse Rock' routine.Also intriguing is an early glimpse of the first Hollywood musicals, with Joan Crawford, Jack Benny, Marion Davies and others doing an awkward version of 'Singin' in the Rain', complete with overweight chorus girls and early color.Film nostalgia of the highest kind--a treasure for fans of MGM musicals. Those were the days!!",10
309,7,MGM at its best,"Having seen the previous two installments of this series about MGM's great years, we hadn't seen the last one, but thanks to TCM, which showed it recently, we now have completed the cycle. The documentary, directed by Bud Friedgen and Michael Sheridan, brings us back to the golden years of the studio that boasted it had more stars than any one else in Hollywood.This new version concentrates on the singing and dancing stars. Its 113 minutes running time flies by without noticing because of the quality of the material selected to be shown.There is a magnificent black and white sequence showing Eleanor Powell performing a number and at the same time on a second screen we are taken to the actual filming of the routine as the technicians worked on it. Even for the time when it was filmed, it was revolutionary. Also, we see a dance routine by Fred Astaire with two different costumes and the same music shown on split screen where the ""master"" himself performs the exact same steps in both sequences. Amazing!The only sad note of the documentary is to see how Lena Horne, a talented and gorgeous black woman who was employed by the studio, but was never given a starring role on films that involved other white actors. In fact, it's a shame she lost a plum role in ""Showboat"" because of the discrimination at the time.It was great to watch the MGM stars narrating the different segments. Thus, we saw June Allyson, Cyd Charisse, Ann Miller, Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds, Esther Williams, Howard Keel introducing the different production numbers in the documentary.Without a doubt, Hollywood was a factory of dreams and MGM was the best place where they came true.",7
309,4,Nice Features In Here That We Never Seen Before,"This last ""Entertainment"" installment offers a few different aspects that the first two ""That's Entertainment!"" packages didn't have, such as some song-dance routines that never made it on screen (and should have) or a behind-the-scenes look at cameramen filming a particular number. The latter is interesting to see as they filmed an Eleanor Powell dance (""Lady Be Good"")It also was interesting to see some of the stars in the early '90s when this was made, as they host certain segments of this 113-minute tribute. I am referring to June Allyson, Cyd Charisse, Lena Horne, Howard Keel, Gene Kelly, Ann Miller, Debbie Reynolds, Mickey Rooney and Esther Williams. I'd say the person who most looked a lot like they did when they were much younger was Horne.I also appreciated the fact they showed quite a bit of numbers in the widescreen format, something we never saw viewing these great musicals on VHS. We also see a very early edition of ""Singin In The Rain,"" with the likes of Jack Benny and Joan Crawford.Overall, a worthy edition to the ""That's Entertainment!"" package.",10
312,4,"We say ""sexually liberated"", they said ""whore"".","""My Cousin Rachel"" is the second film to have been based upon the novel by Daphne du Maurier. The first was made in 1952, only a year after the novel was first published. The action takes place in early Victorian Cornwall, with a few scenes set in Italy. The central character is Philip Ashley, a young man from a Cornish landowning family. Philip is an orphan, and has been raised by older cousin Ambrose, who has been like an adoptive father to him. On a trip to Italy Ambrose meets and marries Rachel, a half-Italian cousin to both himself and Philip, but later dies in mysterious circumstances.We learn that Ambrose attempted to leave his fortune to Rachel but never signed the will, leaving Philip as his sole heir. When Philip and Rachel meet for the first time, he is smitten with love for the beautiful older woman. He is, however, never sure whether he can trust her. He discovers letters from Ambrose, suggesting that his wife may have been trying to poison him for his money. We are left with two possibilities. On the one hand, Rachel may indeed be a sinister poisoner. On the other hand, Ambrose may have fallen prey to delusions produced by the same illness which was eventually to kill him and Rachel may therefore be the innocent victim of unjustified suspicion.The film is unusually sexually explicit for one made in the traditional British ""heritage cinema"" style; there are several instances of bad language and a love scene between Philip and Rachel. (Rachel Weisz described her character as ""sexually liberated""). There is, of course, a reason why the makers of period dramas tend to avoid such matters. In the 19th century swearing was regarded as socially unacceptable, at least in polite circles; even ""bloody"", today a relatively mild oath, was considered shocking. As for ""sexual liberation"", that is generally an anachronistic concept in period dramas set at any time prior to the mid-twentieth century. Victorian women, even independent-minded and free-thinking ones, did not normally claim the right to sleep with any man who took their fancy. Those who did would have been designated by the most opprobrious terms. We say ""sexually liberated"", they said ""whore"".I think, however, that there is a reason why writer-director Roger Michell introduced a sexual element into the storyline, and this reason has nothing to do with a mere desire to titillate or the need to court controversy for controversy's sake. In the 1952 version, the question of whether Rachel, played in that film by Olivia de Havilland, is a villainess or a virtuous heroine is quite deliberately left ambiguous. I felt, moreover, that although ambiguity can in some circumstances be artistically beneficial, it does not work in the context of that particular film, which might have been improved had it come down on one side or the other argument.Here, however, although Michell never definitely says whether Rachel is a murderess or not, the one thing she cannot be called is a virtuous heroine. By the moral standards of Victorian England she is an immoral woman. Even by 21st century moral standards, her treatment of Philip, whom she rejects after sleeping with him, and after he has signed his property over to her, seems rather heartless. Whatever else she may or may not have done, we cannot help feeling that she has taken unfair advantage of a naÃ¯ve, virginal young man's infatuation with her, and suspecting that even if she did not kill Ambrose she may have taken advantage of him too. There are two good performances from Weisz and from Sam Claflin, an actor I had not come across before, as Philip.The film is attractively shot with a good deal of attention to period detail, although its look is less visually sumptuous than some period dramas, doubtless because the Ashleys are minor provincial gentry rather than grand aristocracy. (It is Rachel, with her elaborate dresses, who seems more sophisticated). Following on from the Jane Austen-inspired ""Love and Friendship"" and a new version of Hardy's ""Far from the Madding Crowd"", it shows that the heritage cinema movement is still strong in Britain. 7/10",7
312,5,It's a Family Affair,"(RATING: â˜†â˜†â˜† out of 5 ) GRADE: C+ THIS FILM IS MILDLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A romantic mystery that downplays the romance and mystery.SYNOPSIS: A man falls in love with a mysterious woman who may or may not be a murderer.JIM'S REVIEW: The remake...such a big part of the film industry, both here in America and abroad. The crazy notion that the original needs a new audience is big business with the end results usually being that the remake is new but not improved. The reason for this practice is twofold: 1. to bring instant revenue from a known product and 2. to update for today's modern moviegoers and re-imagine that original source. ï¿¼The film adaptations of Daphne Du Maurer's romance mystery, My Cousin Rachel, seem to have a difficult go from the start. The plot lays down an interesting premise about love, greed, and murder amid the landscape of Cornwall, England, but never fulfills its promise of intrigue, allowing for a very ambiguous ending and questionable characters and actions rather than solve the mystery. Both versions, old and new, suffer the same results.ï¿¼The 1952 film heralded a young Richard Burton in his Oscar nominated film debut and Olivia DeHavilland in the title role. While Mr. Burton was perfectly cast, Ms. DeHavilland played the role too demurely, never giving the character that necessary air of mystery. The romance was missing too. In this current film, Sam Claflin plays Cousin Philip to Rachel Weisz's Cousin Rachel and they too are mismatched. In this case, Ms. Weisz is perfectly cast has the lady of mystery and gives an arresting performance, but Mr. Claflin comes up empty, playing his role as an adolescent in dry heat. The actors try but their relationship lacks credibility as written in Roger Michell's screenplay. ï¿¼The script fails to address the main mystery: Is Rachel a black widow or just misunderstood? The plot devices are all there (the dangerously high cliffs, the possibly poisoned teas, the hidden letters, etc.) but they never amount to much, in most cases. The melodrama is essentially well played but the reactions of the townsfolk toward this beautiful stranger seem off. (They forgive her trespasses rather too easily and rarely question her actions or motives. Yes, some do periodically suspect something odd but they are beguiled quickly...too quickly for logic sake.) As written, Claflin's Philip comes off as a simpleton when he should be viewed as a passionate victim transfixed by her beauty and exotic manner. Mr. Burton could project that well, Mr. Calflin projects strong cheekbones and dimples.ï¿¼The cast of talented actors is underused and rarely hit their marks in this lackluster film. Iain Glen is wasted in his small supporting roles and as Rachel's confidant and friend, Pierfrancesco Favino seems more the foolish fop rather than possible romantic rival. Only Holliday Grainger as Louise, Philip's loyal friend, delivers a fully nuanced performance. The production values are standard and the photography by Mike Eley provides little atmosphere, relying heavily on soft focus, close-ups, or dark shadows to provide mood. Objects and props always seem to bookend the actors as if both are vying for one's attention. ï¿¼Mr. Michell's direction doesn't help matters, but then neither did his script. He paces the film so slowly, uses voice-over narration to fill in missing exposition and scenes, builds little suspense, and doesn't allow his characters any meaningful exchanges. He may be earnest and sincere about his project, but he needed to distance himself from his material to see the end result more clearly.Relatively speaking, My Cousin Rachel, is a disappointing family affair.

312,2,Du Maurier Was A Lady,"Rachel, of course, comes out of the heart and mind of Daphne Du Maurier, the same author who gave us Rebecca and even if we never met her we discover she was a nasty piece of business, she also gave us Melanie Daniels in The Birds, the spoiled rich girl from San Francisco. Here, Rachel is more of an enigma and as played by Rachel Weisz, a dangerously, too good to be true lady of mystery. Rachel Weisz is absolutely captivating and perhaps that's why I was so aware of Sam Claflin's shortcomings as an an actor. I don't want to be unkind. He has presence and charm but I was painfully aware of the performance, specially when he has Rachel Weisz being totally present in the moment. Roger Michell allows the candles, the jewels and the locations to have their moments, beautifully. Recommend it for a stormy Sunday afternoon.",7
312,1,Hoped for so much more.,"I found this film frustrating as I expected a lot more. Had Hitchcock directed it, then in my opinion it would have been a great watch. The chemistry between the main leading actors was poor, and the script offered little, except to confuse the viewer. Unlike the classic Rebecca film, this was dull, slow, and complex, all because the longer it went on the less you cared.Beautiful photography and quality actors are not enough to entertain , and in my opinion this film was such a disappointment. The director might have checked out other films on books by the author, and then no doubt made a far better job of this story.",6
315,8,Amazing Tale of a Solo Kayak Adventure on the High Seas,"MichÃ´d and Peedom's hour-long documentary recounts the tale of Andrew McAuley, an Australian adventurer who, in 2006, launched a quest to become the first person to paddle a kayak across the treacherous Tasman Sea, one of the loneliest and toughest stretches of water in the world.Obviously, the story itself is both amazing and remarkably sad. The documentary begins by introducing McAuley - a heroic, adventurous and fatalistic figure who wouldn't be out of place in the films of Werner Herzog - as well as his wife and young son, friends and supporters.With shades of Kevin McDonald's 2003 feature documentary Touching the Void, this well crafted Australian documentary tells a remarkable and tragic story in a fascinating and engaging manner and MichÃ´d and Peedom approach the documentary with a steady enough hand. They recount the story with a mixture of original footage and interviews, in manner perhaps befitting the sombre and serious tone of McAuley's story. Yet it's hard to feel that, given both the length of the piece and its over-reliance on talking heads, subtle fades and straight-forward storytelling, that it is anything more than a fairly run-of-the-mill TV doco in the realm of ABC-TV's popular and successful series 'Australian Story'. That said, the strength of the material and the measured approach from the directors, means that Solo has rightfully gained an audience around the world, featuring among film festival programmes from Adelaide to Sheffield to Toronto and appearing on prime-time television on BBC 2.",7
315,2,Good subject but it doesn't ever goes deep enough.,"The one reason why this documentary works out is because of its fascinating and original subject. It however feels like its only being a retelling and a look back at events but it doesn't quite ever answers the why and hows.So the documentary opens with telling you that its main subject had died, during an attempt to cross the Tasman sea in nothing more but a small kayak. Was this a good and smart thing for the documentary? Well, it of course takes away most of the tension already but it opens plenty of other doors for the documentary to handle and for its interviewees to talk about, so it's not something that I'm holding against this documentary, though I can certainly imaging some people already being turned off by this.The one thing I was a bit bummed out about was the fact that the movie told you its main subject did not survived but the videotapes that filmed his journey did. However as it turns out by the end, the video tapes of the last couple of days were destroyed by the salty sea water, so we actually don't get to see what happened to Andrew McAuley and how come he suddenly drowned after traveling for 3 weeks straight and having survived a big storm already. New Zealand was literally in his sight but we now will never know what happened to him. So it in fact feels a bit pointless for the movie to show some of the earlier tapes but not show the climax, so to speak, in a not very respectful way but it just feels a bit like an anticlimax.So it doesn't gives you the why and how but it also doesn't ever explain the why's as to why McAuley wanted to attempt this journey in the first, while he had a young son and a loving wife and an earlier attempted already stranded after 1 day of peddling. It was an extremely dangerous journey and many people thought it was impossible for him to survive under these treacherous conditions. He himself also was very well aware of this and he himself doesn't even seem to know why he's doing it and is openly doubtful about the outcome. The documentary doesn't ever answer for him, or makes it clear as to why he would even consider attempting such a thing.However if you look at it as simply an adventurous quest of endurance, persistence and courage, the story still works out well and fascinating enough. It switches back and forth between the found footage of McAuley's endeavor and his family, friends and supporters at the time and afterward, looking back at all, long after they learned about his faith. It does definitely has its moments but I wouldn't exactly call or consider this documentary to be a particularly well made or good looking one. It all feels pretty formulaic and it just doesn't ever delves too deep into things, probably because it had too much respect for its main subject; McAuley and his journey.It definitely remains good and interesting enough to watch but it's nothing to run out for.7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",7
315,7,Amazing,"I loved this documentary. It is one of the most emotional and interesting documentaries I've ever seen.His final radio message is haunting and incredibly sad. The descriptions given as to what kind of conditions he faced on his attempt were interesting and moving, and helped give you an added respect for him, knowing that he survived such terrifying weather, only to be taken out by a set of rogue waves that came out of nowhere when he was in seeing- distance of his goal. The camera footage is also fascinating. The breakdowns he has, and him describing how bad it was when he had to bail out the canoe by hand were captivating.I really enjoyed this, and have watched it more than once since.",10
317,3,A Very Funny Movie,"A dark comedy, a twist that is somewhere between Ernest and Tim Burton, very cheaply made but well done, surrealistic plot with very cool characters made especially by the man Jim Varney. This movie is like watching a dream and then waking up not having any idea what to think, what a great flick.",5
317,5,Jim Varney alone is worth the viewing...,"The only reason that the movie is considered to be part of the Ernest P. Worrell series is because the character of Ernest appears for 2 minutes at the beginning and end of the film.  But you should not track down a copy of the film only to see Ernest.  The best part of the movie is the very dark, very funny characters that come right out of Jim Varney's imagination.This is a very dark comedy about an evil, dispicable, deformed guy named ""Dr. Otto Von Schnick-ick-ick-ick"".  He had a horrible childhood which he blames on his parents (whom prayed nightly that Otto would run away), and on his days in High School.  Now, he hates everyone and everything, and hopes to destroy the world with his ""gloom beam"".  He is heard to remark, 'my gloom beam will level entire cities, and maybe, hopefully, take out a couple homeless orphans and their puppies as a bonus!!'Varney also plays 4 other characters in the film.  A stuttering Australian mercenary that runs a Day Care Center for teaching children how to become militia.  A Pirate with a parrot permanently on his shoulder who calls everyone ""Jim"".  The old woman with the neck brace (who appears in every Ernest movie) who complains about her sons who no longer care for her.  And 'Jim Dandy'- the richest man on Earth.this is a must for any Ernest fan, and for everyone else, watch the movie, but fast forward whenever Jim Varney isn't on screen.",10
317,8,Two thumbs up!,"This movie is strangely surreal, and if you're an Ernest/Jim Varney fan in the least, you'll really enjoy it. The film starts a bit slow, but really starts to come together when we learn the connection between bumbling hero Lance Sterling (great name!) and pussy-willow-adorned, third-hand-on-his-head villain Dr. Otto. Willie the Robot is also a hoot, what with his changing smiley-face expressions, and Lance's assistant Doris is the brains behind the hero. Auntie Nelda is fall-down funny, especially when she's discussing her ""dear, departed nephew Hymie"" or clubbing creatures on the floor with a toxin-laden ladle.There are a lot of little clever bits and dialog that make the movie enjoyable. It may be hard to find, so good luck!",3
317,9,The first Ernest movie,You can't describe this as the first Ernest movie because it's not part of the Ernest-movie genre. It's a wickedly weird comic masterpiece that will have you laughing out loud.,4
318,5,"top of my ""guilty pleasures"" list","This film is at the top of my ""guilty pleasures"" list of films; not a great film but one for which I have great affection. I first saw it in the mid 60's when I was a teenager at a Saturday afternoon matinÃ©e. Then, I had no idea what the title meant. The word geisha was totally new to me. At that age I would go to a Saturday matinÃ©e and watch whatever was offered, and as I watched this film I found myself falling in love with Shirley MacLaine, the music of Puccini's ""Madama Butterfly"" and Japan. I credit it with starting my abiding interest in and fascination with the culture of Japan and for my making several visits to that country as an adult. I watch it once a year between Christmas and New Year on my now worn VHS tape version. I have been looking forward, in vain, to it's release on DVD which for some reason has yet to happen and to seeing it once again in all its wide screen charm. p.s. Finally, Paramount has condescended to release this film in DVD format and it looks and sounds great.",7
318,7,Shirley shines.,"What on the surface appears to be an improbable plot line becomes increasingly plausible due to the combination of great make up work, spectacular costuming, (Edith Head) and a truly amazing performance by Shirley Maclaine. Crisp, sharp focus, color cinematography, interesting locations and set design, combine with a genuine fondness for Japanese culture resulting in an admirable early 60's comedy/drama.",10
318,1,"improbable, but entertaining....","""my geisha"" is charming. suspend belief a bit, and one realises how good an actress shirley maclaine is and how convincingly she becomes a geisha.the movie is fluff. but the attempt to parallel the plot to the libretto of ""madama butterfly"" is clever and almost successful. edward g.robinson as sharpless; maclaine as pinkerton, and montand as butterfly... it is a very literate attempt to use the sub-plot as the driver for the main plot.there are moments when one is reminded of a doris day-rock hudson frolic - expected in a comedy from 1962. but there's also a real ""edge"" that comes from the characters being a little less than saccharine. as has been pointed out, the cinematography is quite sharp. so there is an air of substance to the production, and quality is evident.in the end, though, one just should enjoy it.",8
318,6,"For the young, for the old and for me","Shirley MacLaine is such fun to watch. She dives into her character body and soul. She leads you on and you follow her. It would be foolish not to. We don't question anything because we're in love with her. This movie is a real rarity.I suspect that Steve Parker, Shirley's husband then and producer of ""My Geisha"" actually directed this. He chose Jack Cardiff as the director, the great Cardiff one of the top cinematographers of all time -- See ""Black Narcisus"" for instance -- But, as we all know, a cinematographer is used to work with directors, cinematographers must be artists with a very different kind of ego. What a spectacular way for Steve Parker to direct his movie by proxy. Better plan, impossible. The film is a comedy slash morality tale with a stunning Cardiff like look and a delicious performance by MacLaine. Yves Montand plays her husband. His English is tentative at best but he is unquestionably charming in a clumsy written part. Edward G Robinson is another plus. His character's delight is utterly contagious. Many of my contemporaries are to jaded to enjoy this film, but I've tried it on kids and it works, let me tell you, they love it. Not to mention my parents. So there you are, I guarantee you'll love ""My Geisha"" if you're young, if you're old or if you're me.",7
321,6,Review from 2005 TIFF,"I saw this film at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival.Beowulf and Grendel is based on the Old English epic poem of the same name. It follows Beowulf, a Geat, who travels with his compatriots to Denmark and the realm of King Hrothgar (Stellan SkarsgÃ¥rd), which is besieged by a great monster, Grendel (Ingvar Sigurdsson). Beowulf repeatedly tries to draw Grendel out to do battle, but soon finds from the witch Selma (Sarah Polley) that there may be more the story than meets the eye.Historical purists will probably take issue with the portrayal of the story and with the dialogue. However, judged on its own merits, Beowulf and Grendel is a fine film. The film looks epic, thanks to the on-location filming in Iceland. Butler is suitably heroic, and Sigurdsson does well with a role that has essentially no dialogue, what with being a sub-human troll and all. Screenwriter Andrew Rai Berzins makes use of slightly more contemporary language in the script, but without any ill effect. Director Sturla Gunnarsson has made some interesting casting choices, with Scots actors as the Geats (who are actually from Sweden), Nordic actors as the Danes, and Canadian Sarah Polley as Selma. The cast acquits themselves well, including Polley, whose Canadian accent serves to show her character's isolation from the rest of the community.Director Sturla Gunnarsson, screenwriter Andrew Rai Berzins, and actor Tony Curran did a Q&A after the film: They took a lot liberty with the story, especially as the poem has speeches that go on for pages. They decided to cut loose from it right away, and instead portray the story that would become the poem. As Gunnarsson put it, they tried to be true to ""the bones of the story."" Since the poem dates back to a Norse oral tradition, where poets would embellish stories with each telling, Gunnarsson felt they could do some of the same.There were a number of problems during filming, as they started shooting several months later than planned. At the time, there were a lot of hurricanes in the Atlantic, which results in very high winds. They lost four base camps, and in a single day lost eight vehicles to the 150 km/h winds.The ship used by the Geats is actually the Islendingur, a replica of a Viking ship from 870 AD, originally built to commemorate the anniversary of Leif Ericson's voyage to North America. The boat leaked, so four fire pumps were required to keep it afloat. However, for long shots of the boat in an iceberg-filled lagoon, the pumps had to be shut off and footage gathered quickly.Grendel is supposed to have the strength of 30 men, but at the same time he is not a god, which it makes hard to portray him on screen. They didn't want to create a fantastical movie, so they decided early on not to use any CG for Grendel.The horses used in the movie are Icelandic horses, which have three gaits unique to the breed, and uniquely suited to travel over the rocky terrain.The palette for the costumes if taken from the landscape.When casting Beowulf, they wanted someone unambiguously masculine, who could act, and who could bring some complexity to the role. Gunnarsson had seen some of Gerard Butler's films. While they weren't his cup of tea, he did find that Butler jumped off the screen.Gunnarsson and Polley have known one another for years. She loves Iceland and had asked to be cast in whatever he decided to film there next. Gunnarsson feels that Polley brings something to the moral conscience of the story.For Grendel, Gunnarsson had consulted with creature makeup director Nick Dudman, who has also worked on the Harry Potter films Dudman said that he could build prosthetics, but it would really all come from the actor.Sigurdsson read the script and was drawn to Grendel without any prompting from Gunnarsson. While in a bookstore in Reykjavik, an American tourist noticed that script and recommended John Gardner's book Grendel, which tells the story from Grendel's perspective.They weren't originally allowed to cast SkarsgÃ¥rd as he is not from the UK, Iceland, or Canada. On appeal to the UK authorities, they eventually agreed that it would be all right for a Norseman to play another Norseman.They wanted the Geats to look like a gang of bikers, not some sort of museum piece.On the use of humour in the script, Berzins said that there is humour in everything, and that he is frustrated by historical movies with no humour.Berzins said about the use of the f-word in the movie that the f-word is actually quite old, but he does realize that some people are brought forward in time when they hear it. SkarsgÃ¥rd was originally not a fan of its use, but by the end he was using it liberally.Spoilers below: They tried to stay close to the story, but in the original, none of the characters have much in the way of motivation; Grendel just shows up and starts killing people. They felt that either he's simply evil, or he has a reason, which opens up all sorts of possibilities.They felt that this is a good time in history to explore the hero-myth. Beowulf is essentially a story about a warrior that goes overseas to fight a righteous quest but soon finds himself embroiled in a tribal war.Tony Curran said that his favourite scene is the one where the young Grendel is holding his father's severed head. Berzins' favourite is the one where Tony's character destroys the skull, he looks up, and you can see doom descend on him. Gunnarsson's favourite is SkarsgÃ¥rd's disintegration at the end.",7
321,8,Beowulf and Grendel: an Updated Classic,"This is a very updated version of the Anglo-Saxon poem ""Beowulf,"" using contemporary English.This movie still has the mythical, epic qualities of the poem that have inspired readers throughout the ages. In an excellent performance, Gerard Butler effectively captures the conflicted hero Beowulf as he endures the slow erosion of his military code of conduct. Beowulf & Grendel is more than a story of blood and war. Themes of vengeance, loyalty and mercy are powerfully entwined with the beginnings of Christianity in southwest Sweden in 500 AD. Another theme which is explored is human inability to tolerate that which is different. Gerard Butler is extremely effective as Beowulf, but perhaps the best performance in the movie is that delivered by the tempestuous and weirdly beautiful land of Iceland. I think this movie is definitely worth seeing.",8
321,5,Lovely film,"The first clue that this film is a different take on the story is the title. Rather than simply depicting Beowulf's killing of a one-note Grendel as metaphor for good triumphing over evil, it is the story of the intersection of two fully realized, complex characters. This retelling wants us to rethink the simplistic concept of good and evil. The first step is to give us a Grendel we can understand, and a Beowulf weary enough of war to try.Beowulf is a man used to that simplistic concept of war as good versus evil Â– he's cool and efficient at killing, and when Hrothgar calls he's ready to put Grendel's head on a pole. But he's thrown off balance when Grendel won't engage. He becomes a sort of detective, not the warrior of legend but the imperfect man behind it, simply trying to get his bearings. With Butler's presence and nuanced performance, Beowulf may not be the mythically embellished warrior but is nonetheless wholly compelling, and on a human scale, heroic.Skarsgard is amazing as King Hrothgar, a man self-destructing as he helplessly watches Grendel killing his people, consumed with hiding the fact that the catalyst was his own reckless action. Words like ""walks on water"" come to mind when describing Skarsgard's work. (His performance in ""Aberdeen"" is not to be missed).Grendel, in an inspired performance by Ingvar Sigurosson, is a physically frightening brute with the heart of a small boy who loves his father and hates the ones who killed him. And he's smart Â– smart enough to make buffoons out of Hrothgar and Beowulf at turns. Even without dialogue, Sigurosson gives us that Grendel we can understand.Selma, portrayed like the glassy calm surface of a deep river by Sarah Polley, is the conscience of the piece. Her gaze is wide open - holding no illusion about the goodness of human nature Â– and rather discomfiting to Beowulf. She's delicate and powerful, and as cool and efficient at surviving as Beowulf is at being a warrior. Beowulf goes to her for answers, but not the ones he ends up getting.Andrew Rai Berzins' script is crisp and wry, and short on exposition, relying instead in great measure on the collaboration of the actors to tell the story, and they deliver. Hrothgar tells us with one subtle look exactly what he thinks of the blathering, apoplectic priest. Instead of writing a line of dialogue, Berzins allows Hondscioh (Tony Curran) to speak to us silently, his expression slowly reflecting the dread he sees on the faces of his mates as they realize he's just earned Grendel's wrath. And Grendel doesn't play around - much.This film is truly a team effort, and this is the kind of team we root for. With Berzins' thoughtful and humorous script reflecting the real camaraderie of the talented cast, and Gunnarsson's direction reflecting his obvious love both for the story and for Iceland, we get a moving and beautiful film.Usually warrior epics end with the hero vanquishing his foe in some brave and spectacular way. For this team's Beowulf, the real foe is thoughtless intolerance Â– something not even a hero can vanquish, except within himself.",10
321,7,From Sheepskin to Celluloid,"Breath-taking scenery, strong performances and an unexpected message come together in Sturla Gunnarsson's Beowulf & Grendel. Forget the dusty, inaccessible saga that may have been forced upon you in High School or as a College Freshman in English Lit! New life is breathed into Beowulf, the oldest text of recorded English, first set to sheepskin in 1000 A.D. after 500 years of survival through oral tradition. The acclaimed Canadian director of Rare Birds stays true to the bones of what undoubtedly started as a campfire story of a battle between Man and Monster without resorting to CGI or other special effects. Instead, he relies on the talents of an impressive international cast and an intelligent screenplay against the backdrop of a stunningly primal Icelandic landscape upon which no human had set foot in 800 years. You won't need Cliffs Notes to understand this examination of who and what defines ""Other-ness"" and how it is treated. The knee-jerk fear factor response is as prevalent today as it was in the early Viking slice-of-life portrayed.Beowulf & Grendel owes as much to John Gardner's Grendel as it does to the Beowulf epic. The roles of Hero and Monster do not so much embody intrinsic Good and Evil as reflect qualities attributed to their assigned archetypes. How and why we assign those roles is at the heart of the first-ever serious adaptation of the anonymous poem. The movie systematically leads us through a labyrinth of History, Cultures, the psycho-social reaction to Outsiders and the unfortunate results of those actions to the inescapable conclusion that we are not so different from one another. The ensuing Logic would then dictate that War is merely a lazy solution to a problem better addressed by examining our own psyches.Beowulf is portrayed with astonishing depth by the Scottish actor, Gerard Butler, who is accumulating an impressive array of credits from Attila (the highest-rated U.S. mini-series) to Phantom of the Opera (the lavish 2005 Musical) to Dear Frankie (the award-winning independent Scottish film), to name a few. As always, he throws himself whole-heartedly, thoughtfully, and more important, believably, into the role of Hero, which in less-capable hands might be one-dimensional. Even the screenwriter, Andrew Berzins, was both surprised and impressed by the levels to which Mr. Butler plumbed the character ""all in his facial expressions."" Rising above his mastery of brooding good looks through tangled locks of hair, he manages to have us look through his eyes, rather than at his eyes - no mean feat for someone who is undeniably easy on the eyes! Beowulf emerges as the antithesis of the later Danish Prince, Hamlet, who is so introspective that he is paralyzed into inaction. In contrast, Beowulf willingly accepts the yoke of the traditional Hero and initially and immediately acts without thinking. He recognizes his Destiny in this life and beyond, stating, ""I'll go where I'm sent!"" He does not, however, stop there. Delving into the reasons behind his mission, he becomes a relentless, if uneasy, historical detective, needing to unearth the cause of the troll/monster Grendel's savagery.The Hero's journey, punctuated by pre-destined acts of violence, is one in which we participate and evolve along with Beowulf, with the assistance of the witch, Selma (appropriately ambiguously played by the popular Canadian actress, Sarah Polley). Although she and Beowulf do pair off at one point, theirs is not really a romantic connection. She serves as a sort of conduit between Beowulf and Grendel, leveling the playing field between them.Grendel is splendidly brought to heartbreaking life by Iceland's biggest Star, Ingvar Sigurdsson. Interestingly, his 4-year-old son makes a very credible acting debut as the young Grendel, orphaned in no uncertain terms at the start of the movie and laying the foundation for the carnage to come. Harking more to Gardner's Grendel than the unremittingly bloodthirsty troll of the original poem, Mr. Sigurdsson manages to express both the innocence and tragedy of Grendel with gusto, exploring his un-human characteristics without judgment. It is a tribute to his talent that rather than being horrified by a scene in which we see Grendel bowling with victims' severed heads, we identify with the spirit of pure Joy breaking through a monster's lonely existence.Providing a context for the Hero/Monster mythos is a superb cast of supporting characters. Stellan Skarsgard is the alcoholic Danish king Hrothgar, not only unwilling to accept responsibility for the scourge of Grendel, but not even wanting to consider ""why a f***ing troll does what a f***ing troll does."" Eddie Marsden plays the foaming-at-the-mouth crazed Irish Catholic priest, Brendan, heralding the advent of Christianity and the desire of a people to unburden themselves of any and all accountability for their actions. And Ronan Vibert embodies the equivalent of modern day mass media as the Bard, Thorkel, through whom the saga is transformed (over Beowulf's objections) into a revisionist history which does not bear close examination. As Martin Delaney notes as the young warrior, Thorfinn, what we are left with are ""tales of sh*t."" The old Beowulf is not gone. The tone of the original oral tradition is maintained by Berzins' strict adherence to Anglo-Saxon and Norse root words and an ongoing thread of bawdy humor against a relentless musical score rife with tribal drums. The comic relief serves, as in Shakespeare's tragedies, to lighten and make palatable the raw impact of some harsh realities revealed. But a new Beowulf & Grendel rises from the ashes. This blood and guts epic, with its undeniably spiritual undercurrent, balances swordplay with word play, and the audience is left to draw their own conclusions in the bloody aftermath. The tag line, ""Heads will roll!"" refers not only to the blood-soaked battle scenes, but to the thought processes set in motion that will leave you re-evaluating concepts of and motives behind Love, Loyalty, and War long after you leave the theater.",10
327,9,Not as Dumb as it Looks,"When I rented it, I was expecting to be disappointed. What a shock! An awesome film with a delightfully goofy plot. I did not find it offensive in any reagrd. In fact, I disagree with those who have called the film ""stupid"" or ""dumb"" or void of any real social commentary. In a nutshell, Almost everyone Jimmy encounters on his adventure is trapped in their own self imposed bubble. Truth is, we all find ways to insulate ourselves from the world, and impose ""Bubbles"" to convince ourselves of non-existent limitations that prevent us from being and doing what we want. The film's irony and beauty lies in the fact that while Jimmy's bubble is the most obvious, he is the free-est character in the film. He refuses to accept the limitations of his bubble, and will follow his heart no matter what the cost. How many of us can look in the mirror and say the same about ourselves? Well worth the cost of rental. One of the least recognized film jewels of the century so far.",10
327,1,Roller-coaster freakshow of John Waters-ish fun,"It's obvious reading the comments here that the people who got this film completely got it and those who didn't did not understand it at all.  I griped about how dumb this looked when it was released (the ad campaign was a joke) and never had any intention of seeing it.  But Gylenhaal bowled me over in `The Good Girl,' so I decided I had to see his other films.The film's certainly not for all tastes, but will appeal to people who've liked John Waters' films from the past decade.  Yes, it's politically incorrect.  But that's a big part of the fun!  Most of the jokes are delivered with a dry sense of irony (case in point, the guy in the ticket booth).  The entire cast gives hilarious performances from Swoosie Kurtz in an outrageous psycho-mother performance to `Working's Arden Myrin as head-Lorraine, the psycho cult-follower.  A big part of the fun is that all of the characters ARE psycho and off-kilter.  Much like the TV-series `The Oblongs,' the psychos in this film aren't scarred by their shortcomings, they revel in them...  Which is why it isn't offensive unless you're politically correct and easily offended.It feels like this movie should have been made 20 years ago.  It has a real '80s feel to it, and the multiple `Land of the Lost' references (the spoof scene is hysterical) feel about 15 years out of place.  There's no gross-out sexual humor, which is both refreshing and unusual in this post-`There's Something About Mary' age of films.  It just has a twisted-wholesome 80s sense about it.My one and only complaint is the running time.  At 83 mins, it left me wanting more.  Many of the scenes seem choppy, as if big parts of the scenes are missing (Bubble Boy's confrontation with Dr. Phreak for one).  The entire opening sequence seems as if it should have gone on longer, and instead they compensated with voice-overs and musical overdubs to push it forward faster.  It wouldn't bother me if there were a `deleted scenes' section on the DVD, but like most of Touchstone's DVD releases, there's little for extras.All in all, a great little underrated film!",10
327,6,What A Bloody GREAT Movie,"I caught this movie by mistake after it was broadcast on BBC1 at midnight last night, I just had to go straight out and get the DVD. It only had a one star rating in my television magazine which I think is terrible. It was a highly entertaining film which myself at 26, my 24 year old girlfriend, my 53 year old mother and even my very young daughter highly enjoyed - A really entertaining, pleasant family movie and obviously VERY under-rated in the UK. It was just one laugh after another, a really uplifting, funny story with a not-too over the top ending (although it was a little predictable). I would, however, like to send my respect to the family & friends of Matthew McGrory, as he always played great characters in all of his movies - I was very shocked and upset to hear that he passed away earlier this year, he will be immortalised by all of the great roles that he entertained the world with.",7
327,4,Perfect Modern Day Farce,"OK, I admit it. I was a child of the 80's. I distinctly remember sitting in elementary school and reading about the boy who lived in a bubble in my Weekly Reader. Naturally, when I saw the trailer for this movie, I asked myself, ""Hey, whatever happened to that boy that lived in a bubble?"" I knew I had to watch this to satisfy my curiosity. You've got the perfect character...an odd teenage boy that lives in a bubble. Write up an adventurous plot and throw in a cameo by Fabio and some M. C. Hammer on the soundtrack, and you've got yourself a movie that no Gen-X'er can resist.I was fully expecting this film to be along the lines of ""Wayne's World"" or ""A Night at the Roxbury."" The characters are hilarious and exaggerated, but the non-existent plot drags on like a 10 minute skit that has gone 80 minutes too long. To my surprise, Bubble Boy has a fast-moving plot. OK, it is somewhat of an overused plot: Boy falls in love with girl; Girl gets engaged to someone else; Boy interrupts the wedding to get the girl back. You've watched enough movies like this to know how it is going to end, but, as always, it's the journey that Bubble Boy takes to get there that makes this movie interesting and redeeming. Just when you think Jimmy is finally on his way to Niagara Falls, and the movie is going to start dragging, BAM! The ice cream truck hits a cow! After mud wrestling two women while Japanese male spectators cheer him on, Jimmy is back on his way. Just when you think it can't get any more crazy, it does. That bubble plastic must be some tough stuff.There is an important lesson can be learned from this movie. It is best expressed by Jimmy's dad who is really the only normal character, and only speaks once in the entire movie. He asks, ""What if Neil Armstrong flew to the moon, but never set foot on it?"" This movie is about taking chances...breaking out of our so-called bubbles, and experiencing life...not just sitting around watching it pass us by.The dialogue and the jokes can be lame sometimes, but the humor really comes from the absurdity of the characters and the improbable situations the main character runs into. I have to give the writers an A+ for imagination. The movie is sanitized for younger viewers, but gives a wink and a nod to more mature viewers. This is a perfect modern day farce if you are looking for a light and uplifting comedy at the rental store.FYI, in case you wondered, the original bubble boy, David, died at the age of 13 back in 1984 after an unsuccessful bone marrow transplant. Today, infants born without immunity to disease undergo the transplant procedure at a young age, so they don't have to live the rest of their lives in a bubble.",10
328,3,"Excess with good reason, good skill, and great results!","Marty McFly is back, and this time he has to travel back to 1955 after an unfortunate incident which took place in 2015 so that he can prevent the destruction of the peaceful society of Hill Valley (what a great fictional name!). The film provides two hours of absolutely wonderful and fun entertainment. Every paradox and logical problem of time-travel is explained very well in the film itself, and those that are left out are easily overlooked due to the creativeness of the rest of the film. Who cares that if Marty leaves 1985 in a time machine to 2015, there would be no Marty left in 1985 to grow to up into the 47 year old Marty in 2015? This movie is so much fun that things like this are gladly forgotten about in order to accept the huge amount of satisfaction delivered by the film. The Back To The Future trilogy is a perfect example of the need to be willing to abandon at least a tiny bit of logic in order to fully enjoy a movie. This suspension of disbelief is necessary for a person to be able to truly experience the effectiveness of all three Back To The Future films, and this experience truly is a great one. It is so rare that a film or a series of films comes along that is so well written and perfectly acted and directed as the Back To The Future movies are. Although I realize that another sequel would probably be disastrous to the credibility of the series as a whole, I have to admit that I have always been disappointed that they stopped at the third film. All three are so much fun that they leave you wishing that the story left room for a few more sequels.",10
328,1,"Solid sequel in ""Back to the Future"" trilogy dosen't deserve the hate my favorite time travel movie","Back to the Future Part II is an solid sequel to the first one which Back to the Future (1985) is a masterpiece. This is a fun travel science fiction comedy in the trilogy. It deals with paradox past traveling. From traveling with Time machine Car ""DeLorean"" in to the future and back to the past again. This film is a 8 in my opinion it doesn't deserve the hate, like mostly viewers stated. I love ""Back to the Future"" trilogy it is one of my all time favorite trilogy's of all time. I grew up with this trilogy I have seen the first one on VHS as a kid. Years later I have seen the sequels on TV. I love this movie to death and it is my third favorite film in the trilogy. Don't get me wrong but I have enjoyed Back to the Future Part III more than part II and think the third film is the most underrated film in the trilogy and unappreciated. This film does have the comedy and the humor in it.I Love, Love this film so so so much, it is a great direction from Robert Zemeckis and brilliant writing from Bob Gale. Back to the Future Part II was nominated for an Oscar. I really did missed 21st October 2015 an important event date from this film in the trilogy that reached 30 year anniversary in the year 2015 when the trilogy come out respectfully on a Blu-ray. Back to the Future Part II (1989)The story continues when Doctor Emmett Brown, Marty McFly and Jennifer traveling in to the future 2015 to fix Marty's and Jennifer's future in which Marty has to save his son from been jailed. His arch enemy Biff Tannen steals Marty's idea and steal's Gray's Sports Almanac only to travel back in to the past November 12, 1955 to change the alternative time line paradox in which Biff creates the timeline in the year 1985. The same alternative timeline and paradox was also used in The Flash Season 3 Episode 1 Flashpoint. Than the story sets Marty and Doc on the hunt for a Gray's Sports almanac from Biff in the year 1955 in which Biff is a teenager. The chase and a race on the road in which Marty is in Biff's car try's to get the Almanac back and Biff crashes with his car in the truck of manure is my favorite scene in the film. The Hoverboard scene in the future in which Griff chases Marty in the year 2015 and Marty outsmart them in which Griff and his gang lands in the court in the opening scene is also my favorite scene in the film.Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are excellent in their performances. Michael J. Fox plays more than just one character, he even played Marlene McFly future daughter of Marty.Things I really didn't like about the film and that is why it hurts the film: the dark future created I didn't liked. I hated Thomas F. Wilson's character Biff trough in tier film he was irritating awful person. I didn't like the death of George McFly. I didn't like Biff marrying Loraine. Half of the film was more focusing on Biff than Doc and Marty I hated that idea. I did not like the filmmakers repeat the first movie again in the year 1955. They copied the first film I did not like that idea so sorry. I still hate Biff Tannen in this movie so damn much! I did not like the ending in which Doc was hit by a lightning with ""DeLorean"" and sent back 100 year in the past. The film didn't had a satisfying ending or a happy ending that we wished for. I didn't like older Marty McFly he acted like he is stupid in the movie that is why I prefer III over this film more. Claudia Wells and Crispin Glover did not return to reprise their roles. I am surprised that actress Elisabeth Shue accept the role of Jennifer but she declined the role for The Karate Kid Part II weird. This film get's 8 ""Back to the Future"" is my favorite trilogy of all time and I love this movie to death. I hope they don't make Part IV because it will be disaster. It is rated PG for language throughout, some suggestive content and violence. I miss movies like this they don't make em' like this anymore.",10
328,6,Best time travel adventure!,"As a huge BTTF fan, I have to admit that this is the best BTTF flick ever made. It has all the ingredients to please all audience of any age. I personally like the 50's stuff in it, but I am also a huge 80's fan (the present in the movie) and the future is just hilarious. Of course...it has been almost two decades since this movie came out, and now we know that the future that is shown in BTTF 2 is a bit funny, but hey...do you remember Total Recall? Now THAT is also a future that would never see daylight, but at least the BTTF 2 future is amusing.I have seen this movie over a dozen times, and I tried to find things that don't match, movie mistakes etc. (yes..I am a pain in the ..)but the thing is, I KNOW that there are mistakes (like reflections in window glass) but this movie keeps your mind drifting away, enchanted by the great story and great moments. Of course Spielberg never intended to have more ingredients then the past (50's), the present and the future. But almost 20 years later...it is also a (another) great movie to see what the 80's were all about. (so another great moment for people of my age, born in the late 70's)I recommend this movie to ANYONE, but watch BTTF(the first movie) first, because you can't watch part 2 or 3 without watching it in the right sequence.Have fun! (I recommend the trilogy box, you can purchase it anywhere)",10
328,8,Revenge of the 80's: The Franchise,"Back to the Future Part II (1989) was green lighted after the success of the first film. The film follows the further adventures of Marty and Doc Brown. This film and the third installment were filmed back to back. However the complexity of the storyline turned off many of the fans of the original. But this is what I enjoyed about this movie. Instead of being the same old run-of-the-mill by the numbers sequel, the film makers decided to do something different and make this a brain twister film. The beauty of this movie is that you have to pay close attention to it.The film takes place right after the events of part one. Doc Brown comes back from the future to help Marty get his kid out of trouble. Instead of leaving well enough alone, all three of them head off to the future to try and change events. They managed to pull it off but unfortunately they tore a fabric in time due to Marty being greedy and the nosy efforts of Doc Brown. Can Doc and Marty safely restore the space and time continuum before the universe collapses upon itself?A fun sequel with a few cast changes (Elizabeth Shue now portrays Marty's girlfriend whilst Crispin Glover is no longer with in the film except in stock footage). Most of the original players return to reprise their original roles. Michael J. Fox stretches his acting abilities by playing his son and daughter as well as his older self. If you enjoyed the first film then you'll really want to watch this one (if you haven't already).Highly recommended.",9
333,4,Not Perfect But A Lot Better Than The IMDb Rating,"A simple story about a casual but loving relationship across time and 28 hotels rooms. It somehow projects 2 peoples souls in the universe of relationships. There is a beauty to it and the story lingers. It is not an action flick, but it is compelling and definitely more interesting then 5.3.Its one of those stories that would be happy in a theatre and the performances from the the cast which consists of just 2 actors are wonderful and totally convincing. It holds you and you are not sure how you would like the situation to end, without ruining the end I will just say it left me satisfied.I recommend it was worth the rent.",8
333,7,eye candy and emotional insight,"A memorable film, a visual treat, so skillfully shot, and emotionally real with outstanding performances by two people caught up in doing the wrong thing when unable to resist the pull of forces many of us might succumb to or at least feel.Matt Ross has built this work around two characters that are flawed and perhaps not adequate in substance for his prodigious talent but what he has created flashes with real insight into what happens when passion and love arise and grow within the confined space outside marital vows. We know from the start that we are on a journey where anything might happen and Ross's management of that wild ride is handled with an impressive intelligence while avoiding the predictable outcomes. Viewer response could understandably be driven by whether he/she can empathize with the wrong doers or the off screen victims.I can't wait to see what is next from Mr. Ross.",9
333,6,At Least 22 Rooms Too Many,"This thing has one major flaw. It goes on far, far to long. his would have made a decent indie short. As it is, it turns into ""another tryst another bed."" Boring! In one scene the director actually fast forwards through and entire room stay by this couple, and it was surprisingly refreshing. They all start to look the same. They meet. They chat. They have sex. They order room service. They chat. Then it's usually back to the rack. At one point we are entertained with a scene in which he is painting her toenails. Sorry. Not worth the price of the rental.As the scenes progress the sex gets a bit more inventive, including a rather silly nude scene on a balcony. Of course as time and rooms pass we learn more about their real lives outside adultery. They really seem to have little regard for those aspects of their lives so I don't much care either.Messina fans will be pleased. There's a lot of him naked including some frontal shots. (Nothing to write home about, as they say.) Frankly before it was even half over I just didn't care about these characters or even these two actors. You can only watch so many fake orgasms before you've simply had enough. If I never see either of them naked again it will be fine.",2
333,2,Underrated emotional depth,"After reading the reviews, I had to watch it again to understand what someone said happened in the movie that I didn't see, but found myself continuing to watch past that point. The first time I watched this movie, I thought it to be a modern tragedy, almost Shakespearean by bringing together bad timing, circumstance and what could've been. As I watched it again I drew more to the emotion that the characters and storyline is trying to draw out of the audience. If you lack emotional depth, experience, or having ever truly fallen in love, I think you watch this movie and brand it as a cheater movie justified. I think it goes beyond that. The woman having bloomed much later in life was, for all intensive purposes, lacking in self-esteem and unsure of herself. Which was brilliantly communicated by the director and screen writer. She never knew what she wanted, or what she deserved. She only knew to fit into her roles outside of her hotel room encounters. She couldn't bring to bear the question of what was OK for her to have in her life until it was tragically too late.The man was vulnerable, to a point. And like all men, didn't know whether to admit frailty in the obvious presence of a blossoming love with the massive risk of being unrequited and therefore exposing himself to the dangers of not having that thick male skin.Director - I think that the tempo was good, even watching it the second time, it wasn't predictable and didn't force me to want to fast forward. It captured the awkwardness of getting acquainted, brought us to a place where they dropped their guard and even a period of adolescent energy where the characters connected.Chris and Marin connected in this movie in a way that really made the movie. Periods of just conversation communicated something genuine while keeping true to character. It was almost akin to watching someone's reality.There were so many times in this movie that you just wanted to tell them what to do, and as each tragic bit of circumstance came to fruition you were emotionally disappointed. That's the point of any movie, to get the audience to relate some how and ask questions and get emotional. And this movie accomplished that for me.",9
335,4,Movie is ridiculous!,"Obviously the ""true story"" this movie was based on must have been pretty dull. Otherwise, they wouldn't have found the need to fill it in with such ridiculous nonsense. I won't give spoilers but will just say that the scenes and situations depicted as part of the character's ""survival"" are completely unrealistic and quite likely even impossible. Also, I feel the need to point out something else ridiculous and not believable. Josh Hartnett is 40 years old ... So having his mother being portrayed by very youthful looking 51 year old Mira Sorvino is just stupid!",2
335,1,Survival drama takes Blue Square route,"A former pro-hockey player must fend for himself after becoming stranded on a mountainJosh Hartnett may be the George Raft of this generation, known by the roles turned down. More than ten years since he passed up opportunities to play Spiderman, Batman, and Superman, Hartnett is Eric LeMarque.A former pro hockey player, LeMarque has struggled with retirement and is facing a drugs charge when he goes up the mountain with his snowboard. A reckless decision to take an unsupervised course during a storm leaves LeMarque stranded and exposed to the elements.A lasting problem of 6 Below is how rote the plot is; there is not a single moment in the film that comes as a real surprise. The film's subtitle Miracle on the Mountain belies the fact that this is not to be a tragedy, and that we the audience are going through the motions of Josh Hartnett feeling cold for ninety minutes.Director Scott Waugh makes heavy use of GoPros and drones for filming snowboarding shots, yet however he captures the shots there is rarely an inventiveness on screen. The persistent whiteness of the mountain over-saturates the eyes, and the constant choral drowns the ears.This is a shame as Waugh uses his experience with stuntwork and directing Need For Speed to assemble a number of the set pieces with aplomb. Most notably this includes helicopter search and rescue sequences in which Sarah (Sarah Dumont) at base camp comes tantalisingly close to finding LeMarque.There are a few points of immersion in the story, notably a moment that ignited my own greatest fears when LeMarque falls through ice. Yet as a character LeMarque doesn't confront his situation with any particular imagination. He's never forced into the horrifying self-sacrifice of Aron Ralston (James Franco) in 127 Hours, and nor does the film have the terrifying resourcefulness and consuming morbidity of Touching the Void. LeMarque suffers because he has to, in a manner often no more engaging than a rat on a sinking ship.If the bulk of the mountainside action is taking a blue square route, this is an improvement on the flashbacks dotted throughout the film. As with the mountainside, its all filmed flatly, both visually and thematically.The domineering father and long-suffering mother are familiar tropes, and how this relationship might evolve as LeMarque grows up isn't explored. In the drive to tell an all- American tale of redemption 6 Below also leaves out interesting tidbits, such as the real life LeMarque using his dual citizenship to represent France in the '94 Olympics.A point of connection as LeMarque wastes away on the mountain should be mother Susan (Mira Sorvino) who clearly loves him very much, but she has come across as so soppy and one-dimensional it's hard to avoid a vague irritation with her. I was more interested by Sarah and the mountain operation, and would hope to see Dumont in expanded roles in the future.If you're a lover of inspirational memes or fancy the idea of Josh Hartnett nibbling bits of himself, this film is for you. Otherwise 6 Below will provide you with very little sustenance.christophermarchant.wordpress.com @BrianInvincible",5
335,5,Great movie!,"This is an amazing survival movie, about love, family and perseverance.When I saw an IMDb score of 5,7, I was a bit hesitant about watching it, but this is one of those few movies where the score is completely wrong.It's inspiring, with some great life lessons. It's about overcoming all obstacles. It's about family and love. It's about being imperfect and human. It's about life. Go see it.",8
335,6,Snowed under,"6 Below is based on a true story of Eric LeMarque (Josh Harnett) an ex ice hockey player, crystal meth addict who goes snowboarding and is ill prepared. He gets lost in the mountains when a blizzard approaches and has to fight for survival. There are flashbacks to his boyhood travails and disputes with his ice hockey team. His mother figures that something is wrong and tries to get a search and rescue operation in motion.The director has toned down the faith based elements of LeMarque's story but he has also toned down any excitement. It is flatly directed and it has little tension or energy. It certainly is no 127 Hours.",3
337,6,Outstanding movie and an eye candy for all the romance lovers,When i first read the story i was sure that this movie would be just like other teen movies which have the same theme IE love and sex. .but when i saw this movie i realized i was wrong. .this movie has more than meets the eye. .apart from love n sex it shows us the value of friendship n how you think that its socially disgraceful to date a younger guy.. This movie also awakens the youth of the implications of unprotected sex.. I think the main attraction of this movie is the contrasting characters and all the actors have done a great job.. Its surely a treat for all the teenagers and also for all the romance lovers . .,9
337,1,Really delightful,"Saw this movie at a film festival years ago and have thought about it ever since! It's great. If you get a chance to see it, do.",9
339,7,The definitive Hollywood romance from screen to real life - Pickford and Rogers happily ever after,"""My Best Girl"" is the downright American love story, with Mary Pickford (the America's Sweetheart) and Charles 'Buddy' Rogers (the America's Boyfriend) wooing each other on screen in 1927, and ten years after, they were married to each other - a union lasted 42 years for the rest of Pickford's lifetime through 1979. An enviable love story.The (silent) film is directed by Sam Taylor (who collaborated on many a Harold Lloyd hilarious fun capers). On the DVD case, it has ""Script: Hope Loring, with Mary Pickford and Charles ""Buddy"" Rogers."" Charles Rogers, so handsome, young and charming, and quite an athletic runner. Director Taylor included familiar treatment with main characters standing in the stream of traffic, cars swishing by near-miss, not lacking in car chase or chasing after car scenario - but done in a most endearing way, especially the sequence between Pickford's Maggie Johnson riding at the back of a truck, while Rogers' Joe Grant repeatedly trying to catch up with her. Clearly two persons quite smitten with each other - so lovely together without a care in the world.The DVD restored version (supervised by Keith Lawrence, 1999 Milestone Film & Video) has an outstanding symphonic score by David Michael Frank, performed by the Bohuslav Martinu Philharmonic Zlin (Czechoslovakia), conducted by Bill Motzing. Simply love the music! It is so appealing and perfectly fitting to the fairy tale tempo of ""My Best Girl"": love at first sight, rags to riches, family strife and love obstacles, humor and dramatics, tears and joy all rolled into one. Mary Pickford is THE quintessential star, queen of the silent film era. She's so good at what she does, romantic comedy or tough drama (as in ""Sparrows"" 1926), and adept in physical moves, too. The introduction of the Shop Girl in the beginning: the juggling of the pots, that foot in the pan 'gag', the slips a-slipping thing, all delivered with such impeccable timing. Storyline progression played on mistaken assumptions, with timely humor and sweetness of the heart.Don't let 'silent film' deter you: it's a lively piece, with lots of plot turns and dramatics, and the cast, besides the adorable pairing of Pickford and Rogers, the supporting roles from Pa Johnson and Ma Johnson, sister Liz and sleazy John Junior, down to the sidewalk 'crippled Pencil Peddler' (actually a critical small part in the love story of Maggie and Joe), are engaging as any talking pictures, maybe more so. The ""Breaking Joe's Heart"" segment - just watching how Mary Pickford played her scenes, running the gamut of emotions, is satisfying by itself.Everything about this film is quality: the cinematography (the montage composition and angles following the couple, the multiple street scenes - sweet rainy or sad rainy), set design (that crate of a box where Joe and Maggie had their lunch seemed like Paradise till the camera pulled back and revealed wide) and sound (the punctuated cash registry bell, the entry of door bell rings matching pauses in the music) all contributed to ""My Best Girl"" being a not to be missed cinematic experience. Have a dose of fairy tale now and then. Check out the DVD, relax and enjoy it!",8
339,2,classic love story,"Beautiful romantic comedy starring the great Mary Pickford, alongside her future husband Buddy Rogers. As a silent it is one of the best, a perfect example of the art of silent cinema, and as a film, it transcends all time and languages, the perfect love story.",10
339,4,The End Of An Era For America's Sweetheart,"A spunky stock girl in a large department store falls in love with the handsome son of the owner, who is working there incognito. Their ripening romance is threatened, however, by the antics of their two families.Wonderfully warm & witty, MY BEST GIRL was Mary Pickford's last silent film. In it she bids farewell to the flickering shadows which made her the world's most famous celebrity. Fortunately, as her silent swan song, it is a very good picture, with excellent production values and equal dollops of comedy & heartbreak. Mary's face, and especially her eyes, express her every mood. This was the face of the shrewd & powerful woman who in a significant measure had created the motion picture industry - and who so soon would be leaving it.Her co-star is young Charles 'Buddy' Rogers, who would score a huge success this same year of 1927 as the star of the epic WINGS, winner of the first Oscar for Best Picture. Here he displays the charm for which he became famous. Although 12 years younger than Mary in real life, he was a good knight to her lady in distress, protecting & loving her through her final silent film.The rest of the cast is also very good: Lucian Littlefield as Pickford's tiny, ineffectual father; Sunshine Hart as her massive, emotional mother, a woman whose greatest delight is going to strangers' funerals; and Carmelita Geraghty as her flapper sister. Hobart Bosworth gives dignity to the role of Rogers' father. Comic Mack Swain appears as a harried judge. Movie mavens will recognize Nigel De Brulier in a poignant role as a crippled match seller.The film has been restored and given an evocative new score. It will delight fans of Pickford & the silent cinema for years to come.After MY BEST GIRL, Pickford made four talkies and even won an Academy Award, but she retired from the screen in 1933, very wealthy, her legend intact, and involved herself in various good works. Her divorce from Douglas Fairbanks came in 1936 and she married 'Buddy' Rogers in 1937, becoming, in truth, his best girl. For the next 42 years he cared for her, as age and alcohol took their toll on Little Mary. Pickford became increasingly secluded in Pickfair, rarely leaving the upper floors of her fabled mansion in her last years. She did not want her fans to see the old woman she had become. Surprisingly, she did make a TV appearance for a few moments in 1976 when she accepted an Honorary Oscar. Then it was back into the shadows. America's Sweetheart died in May of 1979 at the age of 87.Never a great movie star, but a very well-loved gentleman, 'Buddy' Rogers involved himself with charities & various humanitarian causes. He died in 1999, at the age of 94.",10
339,8,Charming & Funny,"Mary Pickford is as charming and funny as ever in this one.  Her role gives her a chance to do what she did best, and it's a lot of fun to watch. 'Buddy' Rogers also makes his character likable and sympathetic, and the combination works very well.  While the story is nothing really new - a poor girl working in a store falls in love with the rich owner's son - it's filmed with thoughtfulness, creativity, and plenty of humor.Even if you don't like romantic comedies, it would be hard not to enjoy the scenes with Pickford and Rogers together.  They are winsome, but usually avoid becoming overly cute.  The scenario gives them just enough material to work with, and the settings and props are made to fit right in with the engaging characters.  Their respective families - sources of difficulty and complications for them both, although ultimately they too are mostly sympathetic - are also nicely worked into the picture.Pickford certainly had more challenging roles, but ""My Best Girl"" is one of her most enjoyable films to watch.  It is (seemingly) effortlessly entertaining while also letting you into the lives of its characters, with a perfect balance of romance and comedy.  Highly recommended.",10
342,7,"Good story, but a bit rude to the NHS!","Firstly, I did enjoy this film, it had strong characters and some interesting scenes. However, I've worked in a mental hospital and I can say that where I worked was nothing like that! The patients were supervised a lot more and given much more attention than Poppy , N and the others were given. I suppose it could be argued that it was being portrayed as how the hospital 'felt' to the patients rather than reality, but this is not shown really in the film. It could also be looked at in a Kafka-esquire nightmarish slant on reality, but again , I think that would be reading too much into it. I know it is a film about madness, but it is obvious in it what is real and what is not.Poppy is the character in the film that is supposedly sane, who as been sent to the hospital by accident (like One Flew Over the Cookoo's Nest), and this was another thing that bugged me. How on earth can you do so badly filing in a job application form that you end up in a mental hospital?? This was the reason given in the film and I half expected it to turn out that Poppy WAS mad after all, as it seems such a daft reason!I think the only reason Poppy was in hospital was because the Plot demanded that she was. The modern day NHS simply does not operate like this.And again and again I got a little bit ticked off by the rail road plot that sent this poor woman down a pretty predictable decline into actual madness, until it reached its rather disappointing ending.Still, I don't want to put anyone off as I did actually enjoy this film, but more for the good performances than the plot, which turns the NHS into some sort of ghastly monolithic institution very far away from reality.",6
342,5,"""Public service - that's what it is.""","** contains spoilers ** ""If you shite in the bed and dribble all over yourself, it makes them feel better about themselves.""N has received such public services for her entire life and she's a real pro at qualifying for them, at this point. She instructs her new exotic (in this world, completely normal - read, not mentally ill) friend, Poppy Shakespeare, to fill out her application for ""Mad Money"" (what I've heard called here in the States a ""Crazy Check"") with her left hand so that it's in scribbles because she made the odd assumption of printing in block letters as the instructions read. Of course, Poppy only needs the money to get an administrative hearing so that she can be released from her outpatient day treatment because she isn't mentally- ill! N (named because everyone occupies one seat in a circle labeled for each letter of the alphabet) can't imagine a life outside of ""care,"" so she works hard to stay in the hospital's treatment program because that's the only life she's ever had. Assessment day (only once a year, of course LOL) takes a week of preparation, as she sleeps in the same clothes for days, spreads chocolate on the back of her pants, and smears cigarette ash under her eyes. She performs for the panel of doctors, in a tutu, who score her with perfect 10.0's and grant another year of care, where she says she can pretty much do whatever she wants. She's so frightened that she will one day be discharged that N makes sure that her doctors know that Poppy was fully satisfied with the job of ""guiding"" she's done, as her doctor suggested she do.Poppy needs the money to get out of the hospital but, wonder of all wonders she isn't mentally ill enough to qualify for it, even though she's claimed incontinence :-) It's enough to drive her batty with frustration. Now, she's getting truly irate. Which is only a sure sign of her mental distress, eh? LOLI should say that I am a social worker. Yes, I totally get it. And, this is a HILARIOUS movie! What a gem to find amongst a bunch of classics and foreign dramas I have because they are supposed to be entertaining. This dead-pan comedy must be a cult classic at this point, but I haven't investigated the matter yet. It's a masterpiece, as far as I'm concerned.I was laughing so hard, quietly and deep inside, of course ;-) at Poppy's description of how she was brought into the program... she lost her job as an administrative assistant of sorts and went to job testing, which as she got through more and more levels of testing (congratulations!) her answers are found to be ""concerning."" The next thing she knows, an ambulance arrives at her apartment and takes her to the hospital. Surreal? Deliciously delightful - he he!This gem is packed with Masterpiece Theatre actors who give wonderful performances. The wit is clever and so subtle that it's a thrill to watch, as compared to the general American fare that takes it's self all too seriously and hits you over the head to make sure that you got how serious and important it is. This film is a keeper -- one to watch over and over again.",7
342,8,Sniffs and Dribblers,"Following her mother's suicide, N has been in and out of care most of her life, from foster care, through 'children looked after' services to mental health inpatient and outpatient services. Resolutely determined to remain an outpatient at a mental health day centre, her day-to-day existence is challenged by a new patient, Poppy Shakespeare... whilst all other outpatients are hell-bent on avoiding discharge, Poppy wants nothing else.Skirting the line between stark realism and the heightened, farcical world of, say, Lindsay Anderson, Ross and Williams' film is a roller-coaster ride through a dystopian mental health care system in 21st century Britain. By not being explicit about the reasons for Poppy's apparently enforced attendance at the day centre, the cause and effect of mental illness diagnosis is blurred. By heightening the depiction of the care givers and mental health professionals to exaggerated, satirical degrees, the cycle of discharge-collapse-readmission-rehabilitation is distorted to nightmarish proportions.Naomie Harris is great in the title role, charting the slow, distressing decline of someone determined to fight the system, but at the heart of Poppy Shakespeare lies an astonishing performance by Anna Maxwell Martin as N - she doesn't so much play her as 'be' her, creating a character so utterly believable and compelling that the viewer is both repelled and mesmerized in equal measure as we watch N deftly circumnavigate the system, always to her own advantage, always ensuring she remains within it.Kudos and applause for all involved.",9
344,5,"""I feel just like Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman. You know, except for the whole hooker thing.""","Silly but fun teen romantic comedy about a high school jock (Freddie Prinze, Jr.) who bets his friend (Paul Walker) that he can turn a geek (Rachael Leigh Cook) into the prom queen. Flimsy updating of Pygmalion is hard to hate. It doesn't take itself seriously in the least. Yeah it's absolutely ridiculous that Rachael Leigh Cook, an exceptionally pretty girl, would be considered unattractive just because she wears glasses and overalls. But you just roll with it because it's cute and fun. The cast is very likable and the script is good for this type of movie. Matthew Lillard steals pretty much every scene he's in. It's fluff but you'll be smiling when it's over. Can't see the harm in that.",6
344,2,"Nerdy girl, popular boy, a bet, self-discovery, bet goes bad, love triumphs (with some sweet revenge).","Loved this movie. Great for a date, good for a laugh, entertaining and a sweet romantic comedy.Yes, is a pretty predictable plot, but what teen movie isn't? It had some unique aspects that I thought were creative and entertaining.I thought it was well cast and well acted. The parts where I was supposed to laugh, I found myself laughing. The parts where I was supposed to get angry, I got angry. And the parts were I was supposed to yearn for love, I yearned. Whoever rates this poorly, probably doesn't understand the PURPOSE and MEANING of a romantic comedy teen movie... This one totally fits the bill.",8
344,4,worth watching for Rachel Leigh Cook,"There are some movies that make me just stop what I'm doing and watch. Braveheart, Clear and Present Danger, Casino Royale, Godfather I and II, Goodfellas, Top Gun are just a few that come to mind. Not all are classics, but all have _something_ to them that engrosses me. She's All That is one of those movies.Yes, Rachel Leigh Cook is so so cute. Fuggedaboudat. Watch her. See if she delivers one line as if she memorized it, as if she's repeating what someone else wrote. There's not one unnatural act or utterance from her. She is completely believable, and because her character rings so true, you cannot help but empathize with her, and that is what makes the movie -- when she wins out in the end, you're happy she did because she makes you care about her. She's as good as Kate Blanchett was in The Aviator (completely different movies, completely different roles, by Blanchett deservedly won an Oscar). She has that character absolutely nailed, you won't see - can't see -- a better performance.(And for what it is worth, this may be Paul Walker's best performance. I credit the director for getting the performances that he did out of cast of young actors not generally known for their talent.) As for the rest of the movie, you've seen it before, but so what? Star Wars is Battle of Britain, set in the future with a backstory, no one holds that against it. The choreographed dance scene is great, and it IS well cast and it IS well acted, clichÃ©d or not.",8
344,3,Moments in Time,"That the IMDb score is way too low speaks I think to the fact that the intended audience for the film was ... disappointed. Perhaps expectations were too high? Perhaps this story had been done once too often. But the odd fact (and the thrust of this review) is that the film is memorable because the stars rise above the material .... before they themselves burn out and lapse into film obscurity.It was an odd confluence of talent. Director Iscove is well respected in TV but this remains one of his only shots at a feature. Prinze, who had pretty much owned the casting niche he was in, was 23 at the time the film was made and arguably long in the tooth for a high schooler. Nonetheless the chemistry between him and Leigh-Cook was powerful and that chemistry held the movie up when the dialog and the mugging by the other actors let it down.It's all timing. Leigh-Cook never really made the transition to films after, but kept very busy with TV. Prinze never really made the transition, period, but he's still a young guy and who knows? The Pygmalion thing has been done to death but oddly Iscove, Prinze and Leigh-Cook kept it alive for one more outing. Entertaining.",7
379,1,It's a wonderful Bing Crosby (helped by Frank Capra),"""Here Comes the Groom"" was a surprise when it was shown by TCM recently. This film brings together two talented men, Frank Capra and Bing Crosby. This light comedy, with some music, is seldom seen these days, and it's a shame. Although not one of the best films of the director, the film is entertaining and fun to watch.The great achievement of Mr. Capra was the way he brought together a fabulous cast that work well together. Bing Crosby shows why he was one of the best performers of his time. He is always charming and generous to his fellow players. The other surprise in the film is Jane Wyman. Playing a light role she is delightfully playful as the woman who has found a rich man who wants to make her his wife, but she is still in love with the absent Pete Garvey, who just happens to reappear with two cute war orphans that immediately ""adopt"" her as their mother.The other principals, Franchot Tone and Alexis Smith, are in terrific form. Ms. Smith, especially, is a delight to watch. It's a shame Hollywood didn't give her better vehicles in which to shine. Mr. Tone is suave as Wilbur Stanley, the millionaire who finds out in the worst way, his bride-to-be is in love with another man.Another coup of Mr. Capra is the way he brings a lot of those excellent character actors that had worked with him in other films. Such is the case with Charles Lane, H.B. Warner, Charlest Halton, among others. There is a nice sequence that takes place in the plane that is bringing Pete back to America in which he sings a number with Phil Harris, Frank Fontaine, and Dorothy Lamour. Also in the early part of the film we saw a young and beautiful Anna Maria Alberghetti singing.""Here Comes the Groom"" shows why Frank Capra was one of the best directors, and it also helped that he had Bing Crosby on board.",7
379,9,It's Bing. It's Capra.,"If Frank Capra had a message in this film, it might have been that the in America, the wealthy, though as personable as anyone, do not always ""get the girl."" But they, as everyone, get something, and there is happiness to be had.Bing Crosby was Bing Crosby, an incredible talent who could light up a motion picture with his facial expressions; when he sings, wow.This is not a movie for those uptight with notions of a ""Patriarchy""; it was 1951, and the general relationship between men and women had changed somewhat between then and now. You do the film a disservice by trying to do that, so put yourself in their shoes for an hour, thirteen, and let yourself feel good.Hollywood doesn't make reporters like Pete Garvey anymore.",8
379,7,"Not ""Capra,"" but quite enjoyable","This film is never considered one of Frank Capra's best, but that shouldn't keep potentially interested viewers from seeing it. On its face, it doesn't seem to be what has come to be known as a Capra film because it isn't issue-laden and doesn't really make a point other than the ""follow your heart"" admonition that most romantic comedies invoke. In many ways, it's a remake of Capra's ""It Happened One Night"" (1934), and while it doesn't have the financially and emotionally gut-wrenching backdrop of the Depression to give it the weight of the original, it's nonetheless pleasant and clever.To appreciate ""Here Comes the Groom"" is to embrace a bunch of disparate parts. First and foremost, this is a Bing Crosby film, replete with seemingly ad-libbed asides that filled the Hope/Crosby ""Road"" pictures. Bing, who plays a newspaper reporter (one of Capra's favorite devices) but basically plays himself, has as his foil not just one but three adult characters (his editor, his would-be father-in-law and his romantic competitor), plus a passel of kids, in particular a French boy and girl whom he has virtually adopted as his own. The two kids are cute and genuinely good-natured, so when they are on screen, as they often are, they light up the place. Their repeated mimicry of the Crosby character's signature farewell gesture -- a tooth-filled smile and open-fingered hand wave -- never fails to please (except for the final time, in the film's closing seconds, in which it appears that the duo is starting to run out of steam).Jane Wyman is a strong presence in the film as well, and quite appealing as someone torn between an elusive true love and the biological clock. She is every bit the musical equal of Crosby in their imaginatively choreographed presentation of the movie's theme song ""In the Cool, Cool, Cool of the Evening,"" staged in various parts of a huge office, then down a half-dozen floors in an elevator and out to the street.Franchot Tone is the other big name among the actors, and he plays his role as Wyman's rich fiance with characteristic aplomb. Nothing seems to rattle Tone's character, even the possibility of losing Wyman, which may be part of the film's ""follow your heart"" message.Easily outshining Tone is Alexis Smith, who never received the career-making, starring roles that she deserved. She plays a caterpillar whom Crosby, in his own strategic interest, turns into a butterfly, and while Crosby's tutelage is over-the-top sexist by today's standards, her transformation and resulting passion are eye-popping, for the Tone character and his staid relatives as well as for the viewer.With such stong characterizations and actors, Capra for some reason decided he needed something more, so he threw in a grab bag of other elements. Before Crosby and his two adoptees fly back to the States, there's an extended operatic solo by the quite young and show-stopping Anna Maria Alberghetti. And when Crosby and the youthful pair finally get on the plane, they happen to sitting next to a group of USO entertainers, so of course there's a song, ""Cristofo Columbo,"" which brings in fleeting contributions by Louis Armstrong, Frank Fontaine, Dorothy Lamour and Phil Harris. These are tangents, to be sure, and they make the viewer wonder momentarily if Capra has lost his narrative thread, but they don't last long and are engaging in their own right. (Perhaps the ""Cristofo Columbo"" scene is supposed to echo the ""Man on the Flying Trapeze"" scene from ""It Happened One Night."")Those looking for further Capra touches will be warmed by the brief appearances of H.B. Warner (the judge in ""Mr. Deeds,"" a senator in ""Mr. Smith"" and Mr. Gower in ""It's a Wonderful Life""), Charles Lane (Potter's real-estate man in ""Wonderful Life"") and Charles Halton (bank examiner in ""Wonderful Life""). The cinematography in this film is serviceable, but there are frustrating instances of sloppiness. At one point, in a reaction shot, the camera mysteriously lingers on Crosby's editor as he does nothing for about five seconds. It's an inconsequential flub, but it feels long enough to make the viewer wonder if the film's cutter and Capra himself just went to sleep. (It's reminiscent of a similar and even longer gaffe in Capra's ""You Can't Take It with You"" from 1938.)A more egregious example of visual inattention comes during a physical argument between the Wyman and Smith characters. For the actual fight, in which the two flip each other over with quick arm twists, it's all too obvious that stunt doubles are used. The doubles' faces, which look nothing like those of the two actresses (they may even be men), are repeatedly shown, and the hair color and length of the Smith double doesn't come close to matching the hair of Smith. Who was minding the store when this was shot? It's the kind of mistake that makes all kinds of viewers, not just movie buffs, roll their eyes.To its credit, the film does lay out, in albeit cliche form, the reality of class differences. But both rich and not-so-rich are given gentle appreciative treatment. Clearly, the viewer is supposed to side with the more down-to-earth characters of Crosby and Wyman, but the rich are not cardboard villains, either. It's almost as if the message is that there is a time and place (and hope) for people from all walks of life.""Here Comes the Groom"" (a clever title in itself) is a product of the pop culture of its time; it's all-white (save for Armstrong), and traditional gender roles hold sway. But look beyond that and you will find a film that you probably didn't know you would like so well. Crosby, as top comic banana, plays his likeable persona perhaps better than ever, and the film leaves lots of smiles in its wake. The ending may be predictable, but this is a movie in which it's just fun to see the character-based twists and turns that steer the plot to its conclusion.",9
379,4,Master of the Cultured Ad-lib,"Frank Capra in his autobiography called Bing Crosby, ""the master of the cultured ad-lib."" A lot of time Crosby would drop several ad-libs into a script and Capra kept them in. According to Capra they were betterthan what the screenwriter had written. Of course partnering with Bob Hope in several films and thousands of radio, television, and live shows Bing had to be quick on the uptake.Capra wanted to do another of his populist films like Mr. Deeds etc., in the three picture deal he signed with Paramount. But after doing Riding High and doing it well with Bing Crosby, he wanted to do one of his type film. The Paramount brass said no, but since he was unhappy at Paramount they agreed to drop their last picture commitment on his contract for one more Crosby film. Just make a good one.Capra was as good as his word. This film is entertainment plus and a lot of that has to do with the chemistry between Bing and Jane Wyman. Most of Crosby's leading ladies were nice women who just melted with the Crosby charm. Not so here. Ms. Wyman gives as good with the wisecracks as Crosby does and is no pushover. What she is here is a fiancÃ© who's grown tired of waiting for her man who's out gallivanting all over the world as per his job as correspondent. When he finally does come back he has two French orphans in tow. But Jane's decided to marry millionaire Franchot Tone. Bing has to get her back or those kids will be deported. That's where the fun starts.By now Paramount was giving Crosby vehicles some respectable budgets and that included letting Frank Capra hire a lot of his favorite supporting players. Those folks make a Capra film an enjoyable experience.Franchot Tone does nicely as millionaire rival and critics were astounded at Alexis Smith who turned out to have a real flair for comedy. Funny parts she wasn't getting at Warner Brothers. She plays a ""kissing"" cousin of Franchot Tone and figures prominently in Bing's machinations.They were also astounded at Jane Wyman who nobody realized could sing. Why they were is beyond me since she did start in musical choruses. The song In the Cool Cool Cool of the Evening by Hoagy Carmichael and Johnny Mercer won an Oscar for best song and became one of Bing's million selling records, dueted with Jane Wyman on screen and on vinyl.The rest of the score is by Jay Livingston and Ray Evans who were under contract to Paramount and for some reason or other never wrote another Crosby film score. Probably because Paramount didn't assign them because many years later they scored and arranged a whole album of duets with Bing and Rosemary Clooney called That Traveling Two Beat Time. And Bing did pretty good with a song written for his friend Bob Hope by them called Silver Bells.One of the Livingston-Evans songs was a patented philosophical number called Your Own Little House. A nice song on record, on screen it's a great impromptu style number that so many of Crosby's seemed to be. Sung with a group of kids who are French war orphans, Bing does some gentle kidding of fellow entertainers Jimmy Durante and Maurice Chevalier.This is one of Bing's best and great entertainment.",9

393,7,"A well-made, old-fashioned yarn, but the laid-back ballad-like tone will be too insubstantial for some","Of all the young American writer/directors to break through in the last few years, for me, Jeff Nichols and David Lowery stand tall; in particular, Nichols's Take Shelter (2011), and Lowery's Ain't Them Bodies Saints (2013) and the existential masterpiece that was A Ghost Story (2017). Both filmmakers are five-for-five thus far, with even Lowery's mainstream Disney remake, Pete's Dragon (2016), managing to impress in all sorts of ways I wasn't expecting. Apart from being enjoyable in its own right, it also showed us that Lowery is as comfortable making personal small-scale character dramas as he is big-budget special effects blockbusters. With The Old Man & the Gun, he stands somewhere between - it's not as intimate as St. Nick (2009), Ain't Them Bodies Saints, or A Ghost Story, but neither is it as mainstream as Pete's Dragon. Originally touted as Robert Redford's final performance, although he has walked that claim back somewhat, The Old Man & the Gun is a laid-back ballad-like elegy to both the character Redford is playing and to Redford himself. Filmed in the style of a 1970's indie, Old Man is so tied to Redford as a performer as to be virtually self-referential. In short, if you're not a fan of the actor, you will get absolutely nothing from this film.Telling the ""mostly true"" story of Forrest Tucker, Lowery's script is based primarily on David Grann's 2003 New Yorker article of the same name. By the time of the article, the 83-year-old Tucker, who had been robbing banks since his early 20s, had amassed at least 80 successful jobs and escaped from prison 18 times. Usually described by the tellers from whom he stole as ""gentlemanly"" and ""charming"", his M.O. never changed - he would walk into a bank and ask if he could open an account. When asked what kind, he would pull back his coat, showing his gun (which was often unloaded, and which he never fired), assure the teller that he didn't want any trouble, and quietly talk them through the process of emptying their till. He would then wish them the best, tell them they'd done well, and walk out. The story takes place in 1981, when Tucker was 61 (although in the film, he's 76), and had recently escaped from San Quentin. Meeting a widow named Jewel (Sissy Spacek), after pulling off a job, they strike up a tentative romance. Meanwhile, he is pursued by Det. John Hunt (Casey Affleck), who is starting to respect him more and more.The first thing you'll notice about Old Man is its pace, which is measured, to say the least. Ostensibly, this is a heist film, but the crime narrative is very much secondary to tone and character beats. Lowery is relatively uninterested in excitement, suspense, plot twists, or any of the usual generic tropes. Instead, approaching the material casually, he focuses on a year of Tucker's life, with a tone as mellow as a film can be; rather than a shot of absinthe, it's a fine Irish malt drunk at a fireplace. Indeed, even within this structure, there's not a huge amount of character development, nor is there much of a dramatic arc. And that's not a criticism. Rather, the meditative, quasi-somnolent pace is very much one of the film's charms. Additionally, Lowery almost completely ignores what, for many, would be the most interesting part of Tucker's story - his 18 escapes. Instead, he puts them all together into one superb montage.However, for all that, Lowery's primary goal is to create an ode to an icon, and that icon is Robert Redford. Tucker's story is a vehicle which Lowery uses to celebrate Redford; the character is always there, but he exists behind the actor, rather than the other way around. The audience is never allowed to forget that this is Robert Redford on screen, to the point where the performance is self-referential. Indeed, during the escape montage, there's even a clip of Redford from another film, The Chase (1966). There's an obvious correlation between Tucker and Redford of which Lowery wants the audience to be very aware - they are both elderly, and still doing what they do best, reluctant to stop. We can never look past the fact that Tucker is played by Redford, and for the most part, Redford is playing Redford, with the film existing in large part only because it explicitly leans on his back catalogue and real-life legacy. Essentially, the whole thing is an extended metatextual allegory for Redford's own impending retirement, not to mention his reluctance to let go.As one would expect from Lowery, aesthetically, the film is fascinating. Lowery is very unusual in the sense that, thus far, he has never used the same cinematographer twice. Here, he uses Joe Anderson, whose cinematography is extremely unique, with the celluloid having a gritty, grainy quality, almost as if it were an amateur project. This is because Lowery shot on Super 16, doing so because he wanted it to look like it had been made in the period in which it was set. This is in direct contrast to, say, how Michael Mann shot Public Enemies (2009), with the use of fast, seemingly anachronistic, digital photography creating a sense that what was happening on screen wasn't necessarily taking place in the past, but could easily have been taking place right now. Lowery, in contrast, tries to suture the viewer into the past milieu.Another important aesthetic point is how much Lowery has obviously been influenced by Michael Mann, to whom there are several homages - a scene in a diner recalls a similarly shot scene between James Caan and Tuesday Weld in Thief (1981); the scene in the toilet where Hunt approaches Tucker is an obvious nod to Al Pacino confronting Robert De Niro in Heat (1995); and the scene of Tucker gaining inspiration whilst sitting in a cinema recalls a scene where Dillinger (Johnny Depp) does the same thing in Public Enemies.In terms of problems, there are a few. For many, the film will depend far too much on Redford, specifically the self-referential allusions to his career and legacy. If you're not a fan of his, you will get zero from this, absolutely nothing. Similarly, if you aren't familiar with at least some of his previous work, and his status in Hollywood, the whole thing will probably seem inconsequential. Another problem I have concerns Affleck. I know he's a celebrated actor and so forth, but for me, he plays himself in every single movie. There is virtually nothing to distinguish Hunt from Robert Ford in The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007) or Les Chandler from Manchester by the Sea (2016), or either of his performances in previous Lowery films. Every performance he gives, he plays a character with the weight of the world on his shoulders, shuffling around, speaking in a low-key hang-dog voice, reluctant to make eye contact, shifting on his feet.Lowery also has a strange habit of introducing themes which seem to be setting something up, only to completely abandon them without any kind of engagement. This is most obvious in relation to Hunt's inter-racial marriage to Maureen (Tika Sumpter) and their two mixed-race children. This is a fictional element added by Lowery, so one assumes there was some thought behind it. But this is Texas in 1981; there wouldn't have been a huge amount of mixed marriages. Yet Lowery seems to portray it as if it's the most normal thing in the world. Indeed, for the wife and children, life is fairly idyllic, with not a hint of any kind of societal disapproval. Why would you introduce a mixed-race marriage into this milieu without commenting on it?These issues aside, however, The Old Man & the Gun is a fine film. As much about Robert Redford as it is Forrest Tucker, although that won't appeal to everyone, there is much to praise. Made in a key so low, it's practically subterranean, Lowery hinges everything on Redford's presence, and, for the most part, it works well. There's little in here to get overly excited about, but neither is there much to criticise. Yes, the film is somewhat insubstantial, and there's virtually nothing here beyond the Redford/Tucker character, but it's still beautifully made, and, honestly, there's nothing wrong with spending 93 minutes hanging out with Redford, whether he's playing Forrest Tucker or Robert Redford. Whether or not this is actually his last performance remains to be seen, but if it is, it's as fine a send-off as any Hollywood icon could hope for.",7
393,2,"Interesting true story, but lacklustre execution","'The Old Man & The Gun' is Robert Redford's final acting role. It's not quite a fitting finale - he's great as Forrest Tucker, the aging bank robber, but the overall film fall's a little flat. Based on a true story, most of his exciting adventures and prison breaks are glossed over, in favour of him finding late-life love with (Spacek). He can't curb his compulsion to rob banks however, and it assisted by Teddy (Glover) & Waller (Waits), but underutilised.Detective Hunt (Affleck) is the Texas cop out to catch him - we also spend unnecessary amounts of time with his home-life. The chemistry between Redford and Spacek is good, and he's still as charming as ever. Affleck plays an exhausted cop as almost too dreary. Instead of seeing any heist planning or prison breaks (besides a montage), we instead get Redford and Spacek talking in a diner, walking, or making tea.Thankfully, it's a quick 90min film, but the pacing and action could've been much better. Tehre's some chuckles, but nothing hilarious. You're better off re-watching 'The Sting'!",5
393,1,A Calm and Relaxing Watch,"When have you ever been able to sit back and watch a man commit a crime with a smile on his face and not even feel remotely bad for the people he is victimizing? Personally, I always watch heist movies and feel bad for the victims, regardless of how truly endangered they are. If your leading man or lady has good intentions, then it becomes easier to watch, but I've never quite had an experience like The Old Man and the Gun before. This is a film that takes its time telling the story at hand and there's hardly ever an exciting moment, but it never feels like it drags. This is (surprisingly) a true story that I believe everyone will get a kick out of and here's why.Following Forrest Tucker (Robert Redford) after he has escaped from prison, The Old Man and the Gun is really just about a man who doesn't have many years left in his life and simply wishes to do what makes him happy. Robbing banks in the most polite way that he possibly can, without ever harming anyone, and pretty much always getting away with it, the character of Forrest is absolutely perfect for the way this film portrays him. Whether he's in a high-speed chase to the sound of a calm country song or sitting in a diner with a woman whom he's trying to form a connection with, this is truly one of the most relaxing experiences I think I've ever had at the movies in quite some time.Robert Redford has always been a likable screen presence. Since his early days in movies like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid to even small roles in films like Pete's Dragon today, he has always had the charisma to charm his audience. This may very well be his final performance and if that's really the case, I believe he has gone out on a very high note. I don't believe this film isn't going to win any awards or really be nominated for all that much, but in terms of purely enjoying a character on-screen, The Old Man and the Gun delivers on everything you'd expect, and then some.Yes, as I said, this is a very calm film, so what's a calm experience without the much-needed elements. For a movie like this, you'd expect a slow score and music that will put you at ease, along with some solid comedy in the moments where he may be going a little too far for his particular characteristics. The film provides all of that and more. There were moments where I felt he was about to go out of character, but then the film either came up with a joke to make you feel comfortable about his choices or played a country song that was so on the nose that it makes you laugh. For as slow as this film is, it never once had me checking my watch. This 90-minute film flies by, even with its slow pace.In the end, The Old Man and the Gun is the type of film that's very hard to find a complaint about. It has a specific direction and it sticks with it throughout its entire duration. It's about a wanted gentleman who goes under the radar and robs banks, finds love and is continuously hunted by the police (namely a cop played by Casey Affleck, who is also extremely enjoyable in the movie). Look, if you're looking for a complex cops and robbers story, then I would look elsewhere, but if you just want to relax at the movies and have a good time, this is the perfect film for exactly that. The Old Man and the Gun comes highly recommended from me.",9
393,8,"Though it's stylistic choices are questionable, Robert Redford delivers a good leading performance in The Old Man & the Gun","For what is said to be his final movie, it makes sense to talk about actor Robert Redford. Having been in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, The Sting, and All the President's Men, he has a track record of several classical movies, but has managed to maintain a modern career with All is Lost, the Pete's Dragon remake, and even Captain America: The Winter Soldier. How does he manage to keep a lasting legacy when Hollywood tends to dispose of older actors? Robert Redford's personality represents a certain charisma that's so charming that you feel like you could follow him no matter where. His relaxed, more reserved nature allows him to be seen as a classical and modern face that can be liked by most people.I think a lot it also comes from how little he reveals about his private life. You get the sense that he has nothing to hide, but nothing to present either. He just seems like one of the few honest faces around Hollywood. Because of this, he's always played good guys, rarely stepping into the role of an antagonist. What's good about his role in The Old Man & the Gun is that he plays a criminal whose constantly on that grey line of good and bad.In 1981, seventy-year-old Forrest Tucker (played by Robert Redford) is a compulsive robber who has a unique way of cleaning out the bank. Unlike the gun wielding, screaming crooks who threaten to kill everyone, Tucker is more likely to walk in with his team, ask for the manager, and simply tell him or her that the bank is being robbed and will use a gun if necessary. The managers comply as he's never rude, and even charming about it. This puts these people in such a relaxed, clearly thrown off position, that he's usually able to walk out without concern.According to detective John Hunt (played by Casey Affleck), the man assigned to track Tucker, the old man has been in and out of prison several times, always escaping. Hunt spends his time trying to track Tucker throughout Texas, while maintaining his family life. At the same time, Tucker feels confident enough to not only sit with horse rancher Jewel (played by Sissy Spacek), but to also admit he's a bank robber. She too is charmed by his personality and doesn't object. Tucker continues to rob banks, trying to stay ahead of the police and detective Hunt.As a final outing, The Old Man & the Gun is a good one to go out on. A good but not great movie. It does take advantage of the kind of person Robert Redford is; a charmer. Though I was hesitant, it turns out with the way Redford portrays Tucker, I could see this person as this plausibly good a robbing places. I am glad they also show that he's not a complete success, as they do show that a lot of what he does is more compulsory then anything. This is the kind of role that needs a Robert Redford. This is the kind of role that I could see Cary Grant or Kirk Douglass could have played if the movie had been made back in the eighties.Speaking of which, director David Lowery (Pete's Dragon, A Ghost Story) tries hard to emulate the style and look of an eighties movies, with a softer picture and even a grainer look. Though I don't know if this makes the movie bad, I'm not sure why this style was done for this kind of movie. I think it was to have a similar feel for the Redford classic, The Sting.The reason I bring this up is that it results is more of a ""style over substance"" movie that I think detracts from the movie's more character driven intention. It's still interesting to hear these characters converse, but something about the way it was made kept me unengaged. I think if the project had been made more traditionally, this may have sold it better, showing that Redford isn't a product of the time. The good news is that much of the style is made up with the material and the actors delivering it.I'll give this seven old hearing pieces out of ten. Though I'm not sure what could have elevated it as one of the greats of his career, Robert Redford does prove that his charisma can carry a movie fine. It'll defiantly please his fans and those wanting a movie that does feel like an eighties movie; not the cult ones, but the slower, more atmospheric ones like a Robert Altman picture. Give it a watch and see if this was a good one to end on.",7

And it is rather short, so the limitations in script and plot are glaring sadly. However, the voice acting is very good, Jim Cummings is marvellous as Tigger and Pooh, and John Fiedler voices Piglet beautifully. The art work, while not as good as the animation in the Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh, is still decent, and the songs by Carly Simon, especially the stirring Sing Ho For the Life of the Bear are surprisingly memorable.

Piglet's Big Movie gives you insight into many of the Pooh Bear characters. Having seen this film, I find that reading the Pooh Bear stories is more interesting. The characters now seem to have more depth and the various personalities shine through. It's sincere and funny and there is plenty of action. You can sing along with many of the songs (and learn them if you let the subtitles run with the film). We have watched it over and over again. We keep coming back to this film because it has the most entertaining elements for the Pooh series. The film is well made and the animation is tops. The film pulls together all the elements of Winnie the Pooh. You have to love it!",7
493,6,Endearing!,"This movie has captivated not only my almost three-year-old's attention, but the hearts of our entire family!  This movie is sweet, charming, and chock-full of reminders of how we should value and treat our precious friendships! Being the ""tiny voice"" in the group, Piglet and his kindnesses are often overlooked, leaving him feeling alone and insignificant...how many of us can relate to that, especially our children?!  Piglet's friends reminisce and slowly figure out that their precious friend is a priceless treasure!  I know my children have thought twice about how they are treating their friends after having seen this movie! The very best part is the music!  Carly Simon has written the sweetest lyrics and melodies that my three-year-old insists I sing to him before bed each night.  Songs include, ""A Few Good Friends"", ""A Mother's Intuition"", and Simon's own, softer version of Pooh's theme song.Don't miss this delightfully enchanting film...you'll be ""singing"" its praises too!!",10
497,3,Not a Good Film but a Very Weird One,"Gamme People, The (1956) ** (out of 4) Extremely bizarre science-fiction film from Columbia has Paul Douglas and Leslie Phillips playing American and British journalists who accidentally wind up in a small European town, which seems to be ran by a strange scientist. After a slow start the journalist soon learn that the scientist is doing experiments with a gamma ray, which he's using to try and create geniuses. Of course, whenever the experiments fail he ends up with ghouls who will do all his evil deeds. I don't think anyone in their right mind would put THE GAMMA PEOPLE on any sort of ""Best of.."" list but you could possibly find it on several ""WTF"" lists. This is without question one of the strangest films to come from the 1950s because not only does it try to capture the horror/sci-fi genre but it also mixes in some very strange comedy as well as some political undertones. All of this stuff thrown into one screenplay just leaves the viewer scratching his head because it's impossible to really figure out what's going on or what the filmmakers were trying to do. The screenplay itself is a mess as it's all over the map and what's worse is the horrid bits of comedy that are thrown in. At times it almost seems like you're watching a spoof of a horror movie but then you get more ghoulish activity that reminds you that this is supposed to be a horror film. Speaking of ghouls, the monsters here are downright silly and it's doubtful the youngest viewers in the world would be remotely scared of them. Not for a single second are any of them scary and that silly walk they do makes one want to laugh more than anything else. With this strange blend of genres you're almost looking at a horrid movie but what saves it from the ""so bad it's horrible"" file are the strong performances and the fact that it's rather well-made. When I say well-made I do mean on a technical level because the direction holds the material about as well as one could hope and the cinematography is also quite nice. I'm not sure how much they had to pay Douglas to appear in this film but he does a very good job in the lead and plays it straight throughout. Phillips is also very good in his role as is Eva Bartok who plays an assistant who finally gets some courage to fight back. THE GAMMA PEOPLE has pretty much been forgotten over the years but it's certainly an interesting little experiment. It certainly doesn't work but fans of the genre will want to check it out just to see how strange it actually is.",8
497,6,Gamma Goodness,"A train-passage car carrying 2 reporters--one who resembles Prof. Quatermass a bit too much--accidently winds up breaking off from the rest of the train leaving the 2 men stranded in a strange little European country named Gudavia. Once there, they find they cannot leave as those running the country have other plans. They investigate and uncover a mad scientist's conspiracy to control the people by turning them all into slaves of the state with the help of a gamma ray machine. This movie is pretty outrageous and displays some serious leaps of logic. It also features a most unlikely change of heart in one of the main characters. Still the lead actors are likable and the film is silly  fun.",8
497,7,SPOILERS HERE...Is your head getting warm Mr. Vilson?,"The Gamma People is a classic mix of post WWII aimlessness sprinkled nicely with a generous dose of Hitlerian medical experimentation by a quasi dictator named Boronski. Unnoticed by the outside world save a chance happenstance of an uncoupled railroad passenger car with 2 reporters, American and British sliding down a side rail and ending up engine-less in the rail yard of the Dutchy of Gudavia, the whole town is in an uproar about the arrival of uninvited foreign guests.A postage stamp country if there ever was one, in fact, it's smaller than a postage stamp. With a pompous Hoenzollern-like police chief, a quaint hotel, and other assorted hovels leered at by a castle on the hill (that's where Boronski lives), Gudavia holds a hideous secret. The youth of the town are being zapped by Boronski with a huge gamma-ray projector causing two types of effects, geniuses like Hugo, a Teutonic dictatorial little snit and Hedda, a musical genius, able to whip out complex Beethoven or Bach at the drop of a piece of strudel, and morons, goon-like guys who run around with their arms at their sides and mouths wide open, catching flies, and moaning their compliance to the will of Boronski and his broken pitch pipe. The Brit Lothario goes wench hunting and ends up running into one of the goonies..The two reporters decide to visit the schloss and see what's happening in Good Old Gudavia's seat of government. The castle is ostensibly a school, with a lot of secret doors that make the coolest sound when opening and closing.. much neater than the doors on the original TOS Enterprise. There, they meet Dr. Boronski's assistant Frau Wendt, who tours the guys around the school ending up with a sculpture class where they meet Hugo and his huge goon mask, that still scares me. Here and there mysterious deaths, screams and crumpled bodies in the bottom of ravines spoil the peaceful tranquility of Gudavia,maybe you were expecting all edelweiss and shtollen ? A totally trippy festival with an awesome musical piece is used quite effectively to flesh out a who's hunting who scene in the city streets. Finally, Hedda is kidnapped and conveyed to the castle where she, Paula Wendt and the American reporter Wilson are subjected to the gamma rays, while Hugo watches, becoming more and more upset until he finally turns on the doctor pushing him off a balcony as the building begins to crumple in the intense explosion caused by the falling Boronski. Hugo and Hedda and Wilson and Paula are safe, staggering away from the castle Boronski which is now erupting like a big volcano, fade to a happy scene another festival, Hugo and Heda are happy-go-lucky young children again, free of the shackles of artificially induced genius, now just a couple of crazy kids. I think I liked them the other way.You can read into the movie whatever you want. I look at it as a classic that fascinated me as a child, and now still does as an adult. Safe, escapist, preachy but in a nice way, and entertaining. It may be corny and cheesy but hey, I like corn and cheese.",6
497,8,One of a kind,"Now here's a real oddity.  Made before the British scifi/horror boom of the late 50s, this eccentric film mixes gruesome scientific experiments with farcical comedy, set in a fictitious Iron Curtain state.  And one of the stars, playing a straight role, is Leslie Phillips.  So is it any good? Well the clash of styles is somewhat disconcerting, but the film is attractively photographed and the action and horror scenes well staged. Some talented personnel worked on it ; the likes of Ted Moore and John Box, plus John Gilling who went on to do some good Hammer horrors.  ""The Gamma People"" isn't quite in that league but still merits a viewing.",7
520,8,The art of character acting...,"I think the people who reviewed this film are a bit warped for thinking of it as anything less than a masterpiece. This film comes from the glorious days of Johnny Depp taking obscure roles in films and totally immersing himself in the character. Benecio Del Toro's performance was second to none, and I cannot for the life of me comprehend why someone would think this to be the ""worst movie ever"". God save us that we actually have to think a little when we sit in those awful theatre seats. Heaven forbid we're required to use our imagination a little bit and not have it handed to us in the form of Hollywood mindless pap. The film, del toro, Depp, and of course, Gilliam are all brilliant. I pity the fools who gave this movie a negative review and fail miserably in articulating their reasoning.",10
520,6,pointlessness is the point,"For all those of you who decry this movie for being pointless and lacking soul, that was the point! This is an excellent movie, a true adaptation of the book, nothing more and nothing less. It is an unflinching look at the sickening excesses of a consumption based culture of America during the early 1970's, who's vacuous heart resides in Las Vegas, a symbol of greed and debauchery. The pointlessness of the movie is a metaphor for the pointless pursuit of personal gratification and greed, the true heart of the ""American Dream"".If you put aside the usual assumptions about a movie, i.e. that you are supposed to care about the characters, that their needs to conflict and resolution etc, then you will enjoy it much better. This movie is a magical ride and actually works on many levels, not only as testimony to the horrors of excessive drug use, and the tacky, ugly view of the worst parts of America, but also to the failed 60's generation, a generation that thought that ""somebody somewhere is guarding the light at the end of the tunnel"". Drug use is simply a way of escaping your present reality, and all the drugged out zeroes of the sixties were truly lost if they thought that enlightenment and peace could come from a hit of acid. This movie takes Timothy Leary's supposition of ""freeing  your mind"" to it's ultimate conclusion and the conclusion is that you are not actually freeing your mind, but destroying it.Of course this movie is also fun to watch the incredible performances by Johnny Depp and Benitio Del Torro, both of whom I barely even recognized in their roles (Depp with a shaven head and the bloated Del Torro who gained 40 pounds for his portrayal of ""Dr. Gonzo""). Del Torro has one scene in particular (the bathtub scene) which is both disgusting and very disturbing. Apparently his performance was so convincing that he had a hard time getting work after this film because everyone was convinced that he was wasted on the set. The truth is that he's just a damn fine actor who didn't hold back for one second, which is exactly what the film called for. Also the scene of Johnny Depp squealing like a banshee after imbibing some adrenocrome and Del Torro freaking out behind him is unforgettable.The directing itself is fast paced with offseting angles a lot of wide angle lenses. Gilliam has a style which is unmistakable, it's like walking around inside of a Dali painting, everything is distorted and stretched to create a strong sense of surrealism. Yet his approach is much less offensive than Oliver Stone, who desperately throws every single filming trick at you repeatedly until you are pummeled into submission. Wow, look he switch to 8 mm, then black and white, now it's slow mo all in 3 seconds!Anyway, I digress. This is a fine movie, don't watch it stoned, you'll get more out of it, repeated viewings are recommended. I also recommend getting the criterion DVD version, which has commentary by Gilliam, Depp, del Torro and Hunter S. Thompson himself!",10
520,3,"""We can't stop here. This is bat country!""","""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" is a twisted, outlandish venture into the mind of a warped junkie, a reporter who is traveling to Nevada in order to cover a Hells Angels motorcycle race, along with his Samoan attorney Dr. Gonzo (Benicio Del Toro, who gained forty pounds for his role). ""We were somewhere around Barstow when the drugs began to take hold,"" is the line that opens the movie in an expeditious manner, as a red convertible roars from right to left, in the direction of Las Vegas. The vehicle's trunk is packed with an abundance of deadly drugs. ""We had two bags of grass, seventy-five pellets of mescaline, five sheets of high-powered blotter acid, a salt shaker half full of cocaine, a whole galaxy of multicolored uppers, downers, screamers, laughers. Also a quart of tequila, a quart of rum, a case of beer, a pint of raw ether, two dozen amyls.""The narrator of the story is Raoul Duke (played by Johnny Depp), a balding, stumbling shell of a man, constantly smoking or inhaling drugs, his body overloaded with deadly substances. He is in a permanent daze throughout the entire film, constantly consuming drugs every time the camera pans onto him. He is also the reporter, the main character of the film, and he is in such a daze that after the motorcycle race is over, he's not even sure who has won. So sitting cramped in his increasingly trashed hotel apartment, he begins clacking away mumbo-jumbo on his typewriter, desperately trying to make sense of the seemingly frenzied world surrounding him.The year is 1971, the beginning of the after-effects of the frivolous sixties. Raoul still seems to think that he is living in the past decade. He explains that his carefree ways were out of place for such an area as Las Vegas, and in one of the funniest scenes in the entire movie, he visits a conference detailing the dangers of substance abuse, and inhales cocaine throughout the seminar (led by the late Michael Jeter).The movie is based on the semi-autobiographical memoirs of Dr. Hunter S. Thompson, who traveled to Las Vegas in 1971 with an overweight ""Samoan lawyer"" named Oscar Zeta Acosta. According to Thompson's novel, ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,"" originally published at the end of the decade, they broke many laws and were essentially high on various dangerous substances the entire time. In his novel, Thompson used the character Raoul Duke as a relation to his own past, and the pair's psychedelic weekend as a metaphor for the Lost America. After the sixties, during the Vietnam War, Americans were deeply confused, and turned to many dangerous substances for answers. Some critics claim that ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" glamorizes drugs. If anything, it demonizes them (sometimes quite literally), and the constant drug use is merely present to account for the duo's wacky behavior.That's not to say that ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" is a harmless film. Under the wrong circumstances, it could be misunderstood, which is why it was nearly slapped with an X-rating by the MPAA, and -- along with the book -- caused outrage when it was released in 1998, alongside the utter disaster ""Godzilla.""Depp is the reason the film's narration succeeds as well as it does -- a lesser actor might come across as annoying. Depp seems to be channeling the physical freedom of Steve Martin and the slurred speech patterns of Thompson himself -- although he was given ample time to pick up on Thompson's mannerisms, since they spent much time together prior to shooting and throughout the filming process.But what is essentially so fascinating about ""Fear and Loathing"" is its blazing style and blatant uniqueness. Brought to the screen by Terry Gilliam (""Monty Python and the Holy Grail,"" ""Brazil""), one can only expect the movie to be strange, but it is severely distorted to the point of insanity. What is even more intriguing is Gilliam's use of his camera, cinematography and backgrounds -- the camera essentially takes on the role of a third person, as it is constantly moving, positioned at awkward angles against harsh, dizzying backdrops, wallpapers and carpets. The overall effect of the movie is the equivalent of getting high -- only this probably isn't as dangerous. Probably.In some ways, ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" is an utter mess of a movie -- pointless, sick, but yet it is also occasionally hilarious, and I found myself very entertained. I am not usually a fan of these sorts of movies, which only helps account for my extreme surprise in finding that I not only enjoyed ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,"" but found it to be an important art house movie -- bizarre, mystifying, strange, bewildering. It is as if Fellini directed a Cheech and Chong movie. It is an experience unlike any other, and although I can completely understand the negative reviews it received upon its release years ago, I find myself somewhere in between the haters and the die-hard cult fans. The film was released on a Criterion DVD last year; a sign that despite its infamous background it actually has a fairly strong legion of fans. In some ways the movie is as confused and wandering as its narrator. It's somewhat pointless, but incidentally, I think that is the point.",10
520,4,Genius + Genius = ...,"'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' was originally an Article published in two parts in Rolling Stone Magazine. It was written by Hunter S. Thompson. It tells the story of a journalist reporting on the Mint 500 in Las Vegas.Terry Gilliam (the Director) is an accomplished film maker who began his career as one of the members of Monty Python. He did all of their animations.These two men on their own are incredibly clever and gifted artists in their chosen medium. What we get from this combination is one of the best films ever made. It is a more or less true story. It is a wonderful view on the warped nature of American 'Culture' from a completely askew angle. Drugs, drugs and more drugs, but instead of preaching their evils or telling you how fabulous life is when you're on acid, you get a very unbiased experienced approach to their use and abuse. Visually the film is amazing and both Johnny Depp and Benizio Del Toro are true to the book. I couldn't possibly recommend this film more highly.",10
